FUNCTION

$
This mechanism is called as Four-Bar slider mechanism and it converts rotary motion to reciprocating motion. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The mechanism consists of six links and has 1 degree of freedom. This mechanism can be derived by adding a dyad to the simple slider crank mechanism. The dyad should be connected to coupler link and the ground link. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
With proper dimensions, the rotation of the input link can be used to impart an almost-constant velocity motion to the slider with in the slot.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to convert rotary motion to reciprocating motion. This can be interpreted as change of state from rest to reciprocating motion. This can be described as follows:

The input crank (part) rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to torque applied by the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and crank (organ).

The slider (part) slides in the guide ways (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the slider and the coupling rod (organ).
