SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to convert rotary motion to reciprocating motion. This can be interpreted as change of state from rest to reciprocating motion. This can be described as follows:

The input crank (part) rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to torque applied by the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and crank (organ).

The slider (part) slides in the guide ways (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the slider and the coupling rod (organ).
