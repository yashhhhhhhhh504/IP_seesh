SUMMARY
$
This mechanism is called the rack and gear sector and is used to convert the rotary motion of the crank into oscillating motion of the gear segment. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The rack (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input), which in turn is mounted on the input shaft. This activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the rack and the crank in the direction of motion (organ).

The rack support (part) slides along the rack and also oscillates (physical phenomenon). The other end of the rack support is mounted on the output shaft.  This is due to the oscillation of the rack (input) and requires the presence of sliding contact between the rack and rack support (organ).

The eccentric gear segment (part) that is mounted on the output shaft oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the oscillation of the rack (input) and which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of meshing between the gear sector and the rack and also the presence of zero degree of freedom between the gear segment and the output shaft (organ).
