SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate straight-line motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to straight-line motion. This can be described as follows:

The input link (part) rotates in the vertical plane (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on to it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the large sprocket and the input link (organ).

The output link (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input link (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (Physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the input link and the output link (organ).

One of the ends of the output link (part) moves along a straight line (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input link (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the output link and the input link (organ).
