FUNCTION

$
This mechanism is called as Three-Gear stroke multiplier and it converts rotary motion to reciprocating motion. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The mechanism consists of 8 links, three of which are gears. All the three gears are mounted on a single link and are connected in series. There are 6 revolute pairs, 2 gear pairs and one prismatic pair in the kinematic structure.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The rotation of the input gear causes the connecting link, attached to the machine frame, to oscillate. This action produces a large-stroke reciprocating motion in the output slider.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to convert rotary motion into reciprocating motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to reciprocating motion. This can be described as follows:

The input gear (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the input gear (organ).

The link 5 (part) that is connected to the frame oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the gear 2 (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the link 4 and the link 5 (organ).

The slider (part) slides in the guide ways (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the gear 3 (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the slider and the guide ways (organ).
