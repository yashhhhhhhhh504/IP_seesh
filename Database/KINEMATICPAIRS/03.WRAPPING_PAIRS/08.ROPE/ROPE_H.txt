SUMMARY	
$
This can be used to connect two pulleys. This can be described as follows:

The rope (part) wraps around the circumference of the two pulleys mounted on their respective shafts (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tensile force applied on to it (input), which activates the hook’s law (physical effect) and is necessary for the rope to have the necessary tensile strength (organ).


The rope (part) moves over the pulley surface (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tensile force applied by the pulley mounted on the input shaft, which in turn is due to the friction (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction surface between the pulley and the rope (organ).


The pulley mounted on the output shaft (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the friction between the rope and the pulley (input) which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction surface between the rope and the pulley and hence the absence of slip (organ).
