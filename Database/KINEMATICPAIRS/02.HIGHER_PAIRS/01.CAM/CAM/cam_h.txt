SUMMARY
$
This can be used to produce eccentric rotation. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to eccentric rotation. This can be described as follows:

The cam (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the cam (organ).

The cam (part) rotates eccentrically (physical phenomenon). This is due to the eccentricity of the cam (input) which activates the offset effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the center of the cam is offset from the center of the shaft (organ).
