SUMMARY
$	
This can be used to support shafts. This can be described as follows:

The inner race (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the inner race (organ).

The ball (part) in the bearing rotates and revolves (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the inner race (input) which friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction surface between the balls and the inner race (organ).

The outer race (part) remains at rest (physical phenomenon). This is due to the presence of balls in between the inner race and the outer race (input) which activates ? and requires the presence of a smooth rolling surface between the balls and the inner race (organ).
