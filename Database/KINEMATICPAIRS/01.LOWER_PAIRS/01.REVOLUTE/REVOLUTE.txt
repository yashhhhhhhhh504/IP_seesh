FUNCTION

$
A Revolute pair allows only a relative rotation between two elements, which can be expressed by a single coordinate. Thus, a revolute pair has a single degree of freedom.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Lower pairs are differentiated from higher pairs by the type of contact between the two bodies of the pair. Lower pairs have a surface contact, whereas two bodies of a Higher pair have a line or a point contact. An example of a revolute pair is shown in the figure where a shaft, with two collars, can rotate within a coupling.
$


BEHAVIOUR
$
A revolute pair keeps the axes of two rigid bodies together. Two rigid bodies constrained by a revolute pair have an independent rotary motion around their common axis. As can be seen from the first figure, the shaft can only rotate within the coupling. Linear motion of the shaft is constrained. Thus this pair has only one degree of freedom. The second figure shows a different kind of revolute joint commonly used in variour applications.

SUMMARY
$
This kind of pair can be used to rotate the movable member with respect to the fixed member. This can be described as follows:

The movable member (part) rotates with respect to the fixed member (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied (input) on to the movable member, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the fixed member and the movable member (organ).
