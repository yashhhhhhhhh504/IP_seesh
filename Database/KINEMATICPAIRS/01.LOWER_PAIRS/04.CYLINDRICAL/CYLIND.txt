FUNCTION

$
A cylindrical pair allows only a relative rotation between two elements, which can be expressed by two coordinates. Thus, a cylindrical pair has a two degrees of freedom.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Lower pairs are differentiated from higher pairs by the type of contact between the two bodies of the pair. Lower pairs have a surface contact, whereas two bodies of a Higher pair have a line or a point contact. An example of a cylindrical pair is shown in the figure where a shaft can rotate as well as travese linearally within a coupling.
$


BEHAVIOUR
$
A cylindrical pair keeps two axes of two rigid bodies aligned. Two rigid bodies that are part of this kind of system will have an independent translational motion along the axis and a relative rotary motion around the axis. Therefore, a cylindrical pair removes four degrees of freedom from spatial mechanism. As can be seen from the figure, the shaft can rotate as well as traverse linearally within the coupling. Thus this pair has only one degree of freedom.

SUMMARY
$
The moving member (part) rotates and simultaneously slides along the other fixed member (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force and torque applied on to the moving member (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction free surface between the moving and the fixed member (organ).
$

ACTION
$
 
 Using this the moving member can be made to rotate as well as translate along the fixed member.
