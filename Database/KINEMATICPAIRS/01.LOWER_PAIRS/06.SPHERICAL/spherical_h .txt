SUMMARY
$
The movable member (part) rotates as well as revolves within the fixed member (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force and torque applied on to the movable member (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom in the direction of motion (organ). 
$

ACTION
{
$ 
 Using this the movable member can be rotated as well as revolved within the fixed member.
$
}
STATE
{
$
Absence of force and torque at the movable member.
$
Presence of force and torque at the movable member.
$
}
