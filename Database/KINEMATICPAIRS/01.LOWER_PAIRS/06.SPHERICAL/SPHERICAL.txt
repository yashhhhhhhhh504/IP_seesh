FUNCTION

$
A spherical pair allows a relative rotation between two elements, which can be expressed by three coordinates. Thus, a spherical pair has a three degrees of freedom.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Lower pairs are differentiated from higher pairs by the type of contact between the two bodies of the pair. Lower pairs have a surface contact, whereas two bodies of a higher pair have a line or a point contact. An example of a spherical pair is shown in the figure.
$


BEHAVIOUR
$
A spherical pair keeps two spherical centers together. Two rigid bodies connected by this constraint will be able to rotate relatively around x, y and z axes, but there will be no relative translation along any of these axes. Therefore, a spherical pair removes three degrees of freedom in spatial mechanism. The Spherical block represents three rotational degrees of freedom (DoFs) at a single pivot point, a "ball-in-socket" joint. Two rotational DoFs specify a directional axis, and a third rotational DoF specifies rotation about that directional axis.

SUMMARY
$
The movable member (part) rotates as well as revolves within the fixed member (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force and torque applied on to the movable member (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom in the direction of motion (organ). 
$

ACTION
$
 
 Using this the movable member can be rotated as well as revolved within the fixed member.

$
STATE
$

Absence of force and torque at the movable member.

Presence of force and torque at the movable member.
