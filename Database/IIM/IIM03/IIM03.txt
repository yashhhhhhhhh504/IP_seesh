FUNCTION

$
An operating cycle of 180 degrees motion and 180 degrees dwell is produced by this mechanism.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The input shaft drives a cam, to which is eccentrically connected a rack. This rack oscillates within a coulisse that has a slot cut in it in order to accommodate the output shaft. The coulisse is connected to the cam by means of a lever. The profile of the cam is such that the lever is raised for half the cycle of input rotation. The rack thus engages with a gear behind the coulisse during half the input cycle. This gear rotates the output shaft. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The input shaft drives the rack, while it is engaged with the output shaft gear during half the cycle. When the rack engages, the lock teeth at the lower end of the coulisse are disengaged and, conversely, when the rack is disengaged, the coulisse teeth are engaged. This action locks the output shaft positively. The changeover points occur at the dead-center positions, so that the motion of the gear is continuously and positively governed. By varying the radius R and the diameter of the gear, the number of revolutions made by the output shaft during the operating half of the cycle can be varied to suit many differing requirements.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate intermittent motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The cam (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the cam (organ).

The rack (part) oscillates within the coulisse (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the cam (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one-degree of freedom between the cam and the rack (organ).

The rack (part) meshes with the gear (physical phenomenon). This is due to the downward movement of the Coulisse (input), which activates the gravity effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the rack and the gear have the same module (organ).

The gear (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the rack (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the coulisse teeth have disengaged from the teeth on the gear (organ).
