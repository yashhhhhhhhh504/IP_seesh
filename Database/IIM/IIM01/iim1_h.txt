SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate intermittent motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to small angular rotation. This can be described as follows:

The disk A (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the disk A (organ).

The disk B (part) oscillates intermittently about the hinged point (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the disk A (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of a groove on the disk A (organ).
