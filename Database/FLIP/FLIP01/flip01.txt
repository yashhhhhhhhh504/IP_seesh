FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can turn over a flat piece.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The basic structure is a four-bar linkage and a double crank. The two flippers are actually extensions of the fourth members of the four-bar linkages.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The input shaft drives the double crank, both of which are connected to connecting roads leading to each flipper. In this way, as the input shaft rotates counter-clockwise, flipper 1 turns clockwise, while flipper 2 turns counter-clockwise. Link proportions are selected so that both flippers rise up at the same time to meet a line slightly off the vertical to transfer the piece from one flipper to the other by the momentum of the piece. After the material is transferred, due to the lengths of the connecting rods, both the flippers return to the neutral position.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to turn over a flat piece. This can be interpreted as a change of state between from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The crank (part) rotates in the counter clockwise direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the crank (organ). 

The connecting rod (part), which is connected to it, also rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the crank and the connecting rod (organ).

The flipper 1 (part) rotates in the clockwise direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the connecting rod (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the flipper and the connecting rod and also requires that the flipper be pivoted at a suitable point (organ).


At the same time, the flipper 2 rotates in the counter clockwise direction and meets the flipper 1 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the connecting rod, which in turn is connected to the crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the links be of suitable lengths (organ). 


The material (part) is transferred from the flipper 2 to the flipper 1 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the inertia of the material (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the flipper 2 meet the flipper 1 at a straight line, which is slightly off the vertical (organ).
