SUMMARY
$
This can be used to reduce wear on the cam and the follower. This can be interpreted as a change of rest to rotation of the roller. This can be described as follows:

The roller (part) of the follower rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to rotation of the cam (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of a friction surface between the cam and the roller (organ). 
$

ACTION

$ 
 To reduce friction.
$

STATE

$
The roller is at rest.

The roller is rotating.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
The roller of the follower rotates.

$


PHYEFFECT

$
Friction effect.

$


INPUT

$
Rotation of the cam.

$


ORGAN

$
Presence of a friction surface between the cam and the roller.

$



PARTS
$
The roller forms a revolute pair with the follower.
