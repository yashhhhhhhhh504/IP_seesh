SUMMARY
$
This can be used to absorb recoverable energy. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to compression. This can be described as follows:

The spring (part) deforms (physical phenomenon). This is due to the load applied (input), which activates the hooks law (physical effect) and requires the presence of stiffness in the spring (organ).

The spring (part) regains its original shape and thus does some work (physical phenomenon). This is due to the removal of the load (input), which activates hooks law (physical effect) and is necessary that the spring is loaded within the elastic limit (organ).
