SUMMARY
$
 These springs can be used to store readily recoverable energy. This can be interpreted as follows:
 
The spring (part) extends in length (physical phenomenon). This is due to the load applied (input), which activates the hook’s law (physical effect) and requires that the load applied is an axial tensile force (organ). 


The spring (part) regains its original shape and size (physical phenomenon). This is due to the absence of load (input), which activates the hook’s law (physical effect) and requires that the load applied be within the elastic limit (organ).
