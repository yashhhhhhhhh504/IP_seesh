SUMMARY
$
This can be used to connect two sprockets and to transmit motion between them. It can be described as follows:

The chain (part) connects the two sprockets (physical phenomenon). This is due to the initial tension with which it is placed on the sprockets (input) which  activates the hook’s law (physical effect) and is necessary that the projections on the sprocket fits into the recess of the chain (organ).

The sprocket (part) mounted on the input shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the sprocket (organ).

The chain (part) moves (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tensile force applied by the sprocket mounted on the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the there is enough initial tension in the chain (organ).


The sprocket (part) on the output shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the chain (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of close contact between the sprocket and the chain (organ).
