SUMMARY
$
This can be used for splitting. This can be described as follows:

The wedge (part) exerts an impact force on to the material (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the wedge to fall from a suitable height (organ).

The wedge (part) pierces into the materials (physical phenomenon). This is due to the motion of the wedge (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires that the wedge is harder than the material (organ).
