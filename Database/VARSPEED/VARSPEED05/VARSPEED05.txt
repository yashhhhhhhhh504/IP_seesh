FUNCTION

$
This disk and roller variable speed friction drive can be used to transmit both high torque, as on industrial machines, and low torque, as in laboratory instruments. This variable speed drive can also be used to change the direction of motion. However it performs best when it is used to reduce and not increase speed. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The drives of two rotating disks and a roller mounted on a threaded spindle. The two disks are mounted on a common shaft.  The axes of the shafts of the two disks and that of the roller lie in mutually perpendicular planes. However, unlike the other variable speed drives, in this drive the two disks can be made to move horizontally, and the roller can move in the vertical direction.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The roller contact can be changed from one disk to the other in order to change the direction of rotation. Rotation can be accelerated or decelerated by moving the screw.
All friction drives have a certain amount of slip due to imperfect rolling of the friction members, but with effective design the slip can be held constant, resulting in constant speed of the driven member. Compensation for variations in load can be achieved by placing inertia masses on the driven end. Springs or similar elastic members can be used to keep the friction parts in constant contact and to exert the force necessary to create the friction. In some cases, gravity will take the place of such members. Custom made friction materials are generally recommended, but neoprene or rubber can be satisfactory. Normally only one of the friction members is made or lined with this material, while the other is metal.
The animation shown a longside demonstrates the functioning of this variable speed drive.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism transmits power and allows variable output speed in the following steps:

The adjustable roller is fixed on the input shaft, which is threaded and is attached to the motor. Thus the adjustable roller forms a screw pair with the frame (part). The motor applies a torque to the input shaft (Input) which activates Newtonian laws of motion (Physical effect), and rotates the adjustable roller (Physical Phenomenon). This requires a 1 degree of freedom of motion between the shaft and the adjustable roller in the direction of rotation (Organ).

The first friction disk can be made to contact the adjustable roller (part). As the adjustable roller rotates (Input), the first friction disk rotates as well (Physical Phenomenon) due to the friction (Physical Effect) developed between the contacting friction surfaces (Organ)

The two friction disks form a fixed pair with the shaft (part). The rotation of the friction disks (Input) causes the output shaft to rotate (Physical Phenomenon) as well, because of Newtonian laws of motion (Physical Effect). The rotation requires a one degree of freedom of motion in the direction of motion to exist between the two bodies (organ).

As the second friction disk is fixed to the output shaft (part), when the output shaft rotates (Input), the second friction disk rotates as well (Physical Phenomenon) activating Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) and due to the single degree of freedom of motion between the bodies (Organ)

Since the adjustable roller is fixed to the input shaft, and the input shaft forms a screw pair with the frame (part), the position of the roller on the disk can be changed (Physical Phenomenon). This is achieved by applying a force on the roller (Input) which raises or lowers it along the disk, obeying the Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect).

There is frictional contact between the friction disk and the adjustable roller (part). Thus, as the position of the adjustable roller on the disk is changed (Input), there is a difference in the diameter of the disk at the point of contact with the adjustable roller (Organ). Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) apply and thus the speed of the output shaft is altered (Physical Phenomenon).

In order to stop rotation of the output shaft (Physical Phenomenon), though the input shaft rotates continuously, the contact between the disks and the roller must be broken (part). This is achieved by applying a force (Input) on the disk in order to move it away, activating Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect)

If the direction of rotation of the output shaft needs to be reversed (Physical Phenomenon), the contact should be changed from one friction disk to the other (part). This is possible again by applying a force (Input) on the disk in order to move it away, activating Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect). The direction of rotation of the output shaft thus depends on which friction disk it is in contact with (Organ).
