Summary
{
This mechanism transmits power and allows variable output speed in the following steps:

The first friction cone is fixed on the input shaft, which in turn is attached to the motor. Thus the first friction cone forms a revolute pair with the frame (Structure). The motor applies a torque to the shaft (Input) which activates Newtonian laws of motion (Physical effect), and rotates the first friction cone (Physical Phenomenon). This requires 1 degree of freedom of motion between the shaft and the first cone in the direction of rotation (Organ).

The first friction cone is in contact with the adjustable wheel (Structure). As the first friction cone rotates (Input), the adjustable wheel rotates as well (Physical Phenomenon) due to the friction (Physical Effect) developed between the contacting friction surfaces (Organ)

The adjustable wheel forms a prismatic pair with the shaft (Structure). The rotation of the adjustable wheel (Input) causes the shaft to rotate (Physical Phenomenon) as well, because the basic law that no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time (Physical Effect) has to be obeyed. The rotation requires a zero degree of freedom of motion in the direction of motion to exist between the two bodies.

The second friction cone is also in contact with the adjustable wheel (Structure). As the adjustable wheel rotates (Input), the second friction cone  rotates as well (Physical Phenomenon) due to the friction (Physical Effect) developed between the contacting friction surfaces (Organ)

The second friction cone is fixed on the output shaft. Thus the second friction cone and the output shaft forms a revolute pair with the frame (Structure). The rotation of the second friction cone (Input) activates Newtonian laws of motion (Physical effect), and rotates first the output shaft (Physical Phenomenon). This requires 1 degree of freedom of motion between the shaft and the first cone in the direction of rotation (Organ).

Since the adjustable wheel is connected to the shaft by a prismatic joint (Structure), the position of the wheel on the shaft can be changed (Physical Phenomenon). This is achieved by applying a force on the wheel (Input) which slides it along the spline, obeying the Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect).

There is frictional contact between the two friction cones and the adjustable wheel (Structure). Thus, as the position of the adjustable wheel on the shaft is changed (Input), there is a difference in the ratio of diameters of the cones at the point of contact with the adjustable wheel (Organ). Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) apply and thus the speed of the output shaft is altered (Physical Phenomenon).
