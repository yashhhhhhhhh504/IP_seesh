Summary
{
This mechanism transmits power and allows variable output speed in the following steps:

The friction cone is fixed on the input shaft, which in turn is attached to the motor. Thus the friction cone forms a revolute pair with the frame (Structure). The motor applies a torque to the shaft (Input) which activates Newtonian laws of motion (Physical effect), and rotates the friction cone (Physical Phenomenon). This requires 1 degree of freedom of motion between the shaft and the first cone in the direction of rotation (Organ).

The friction cone is in contact with the adjustable wheel (Structure). As the friction cone rotates (Input), the adjustable wheel rotates as well (Physical Phenomenon) due to the friction (Physical Effect) developed between the contacting friction surfaces (Organ)

The adjustable wheel forms a prismatic pair with the output shaft (Structure). The rotation of the wheel (Input) causes the output shaft to rotate (Physical Phenomenon) because the basic law that no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time (Physical Effect) has to be obeyed. The rotation requires a zero degree of freedom of motion in the direction of motion to exist between the two bodies (organ).

Since the adjustable wheel is connected to the output shaft by a prismatic joint (Structure), the position of the wheel on the shaft can be changed (Physical Phenomenon). This is achieved by applying a force on the wheel (Input) which slides it along the spline, obeying the Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) and presence of smooth surface between the adjustable wheel and the output shaft (organ).

There is frictional contact between the cone and the adjustable wheel (Structure). Thus, as the position of the wheel on the shaft is changed (Input), there is a difference in the diameter of the cone at the point of contact with the adjustable wheel (Organ). Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) apply and thus the speed of the output shaft is altered (Physical Phenomenon).
