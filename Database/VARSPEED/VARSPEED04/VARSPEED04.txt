FUNCTION

$
This disk and roller variable speed friction drive can be used to transmit both high torque, as on industrial machines, and low torque, as in laboratory instruments. This mechanism performs best if it is used to reduce and not increase speed. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
This drive consists of two disks with a free-spinning movable roller between them. In this case, the axes of the shafts of the two disks and that of the roller lie in mutually perpendicular planes.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
This drive can change speed rapidly because the operating diameters of the disks change in an inverse ratio.
All friction drives have a certain amount of slip due to imperfect rolling of the friction members, but with effective design the slip can be held constant, resulting in constant speed of the driven member. Compensation for variations in load can be achieved by placing inertia masses on the driven end. Springs or similar elastic members can be used to keep the friction parts in constant contact and to exert the force necessary to create the friction. In some cases, gravity will take the place of such members. Custom made friction materials are generally recommended, but neoprene or rubber can be satisfactory. Normally only one of the friction members is made or lined with this material, while the other is metal.
The animation shown along side demonstrates the functioning of this variable speed drive.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism transmits power and allows variable output speed in the following steps:

The first friction disk is fixed on the input shaft, which in turn is attached to the motor. Thus the first friction disk forms a revolute pair with the frame (part). The motor applies a torque to the shaft (Input) which activates Newtonian laws of motion (Physical effect), and rotates the first friction disk (Physical Phenomenon). This requires a 1 degree of freedom of motion between the shaft and the first friction disk in the direction of rotation (Organ).

The first friction disk is in contact with the adjustable roller (part). As the first friction disk rotates (Input), the adjustable roller rotates as well (Physical Phenomenon) due to the friction (Physical Effect) developed between the contacting friction surfaces (Organ)

The adjustable roller forms a prismatic pair with the shaft (part). The rotation of the adjustable roller (Input) causes the shaft to rotate (Physical Phenomenon) as well, because the basic law that no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time (Physical Effect) has to be obeyed. The rotation requires a zero degree of freedom of motion in the direction of motion to exist between the two bodies (organ).

The second friction disk is also in contact with the adjustable roller (part). As the adjustable roller rotates (Input), the second friction disk rotates as well (Physical Phenomenon) due to the friction (Physical Effect) developed between the contacting friction surfaces (Organ)

The second friction disk is fixed on the output shaft. Thus the second friction disk and the output shaft forms a revolute pair with the frame (part). The rotation of the second friction disk (Input) activates Newtonian laws of motion (Physical effect), and rotates first the output shaft (Physical Phenomenon). This requires 1 degree of freedom of motion between the output shaft and the second friction disk in the direction of rotation (Organ).

Since the adjustable roller is connected to the shaft by a prismatic joint (part), the position of the roller on the shaft can be changed (Physical Phenomenon). This is achieved by applying a force on the roller (Input) which slides it along the spline, obeying the Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the roller and the shaft (organ).

There is frictional contact between the two friction disks and the adjustable roller (part). Thus, as the position of the adjustable roller on the shaft is changed (Input), there is a difference in the ratio of diameters of the disks at the point of contact with the adjustable roller (Organ). Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) apply and thus the speed of the output shaft is altered (Physical Phenomenon).
