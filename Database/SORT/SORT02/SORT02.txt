FUNCTION

$
This device sorts spherical components according to their size.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This device consists of a hopper, a spring-loaded gate, a trapdoor and two troughs.  The gate acts as a latch for the trapdoor.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
In this arrangement, the balls are loaded into the hopper and are compelled to pass the gate. The proper-size balls pass through without touching (actuating) the gate and fall into the trough at the end of the gate. Larger balls, however, brush against the gate, which releases the catch on the bottom of the trapdoor, and fall through into the special trough for the rejects.

SUMMARY
$
Using this device spherical object can be sorted out based on their sizes. This can be described as follows:

The object (part) rolls down the hopper (physical phenomenon). This is due to the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy of the object (input), which activates the inertia effect (physical effect) and requires that the objects are spherical in shape (organ).

The spherical object (part) passes through the gate and falls into the trough (physical phenomenon). This is due to the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy of the body (input), which activates the inertia effect (physical effect) and requires that the spherical ball be of proper size (organ).


The spherical object (part) actuates the gate, which in turn operates the trap door and thus the object falls in a different trough (physical phenomenon). This is due to the contact between the object and the gate (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires that the object be of a larger size (organ).
