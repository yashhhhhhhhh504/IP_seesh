FUNCTION

$
This device can be used to separate spherical balls two at a time or any number based on the length of the arm on the reciprocator.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of an inclined tube which has an opening at the top and the bottom. The spherical balls are made to roll within this tube. It also has a reciprocator which reciprocates along the guide ways.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The reciprocator reciprocates within the guide ways and as the balls are rolled along the tube, they are separated.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to separate spherical objects. This can be described as follows:

The balls (part) are rolled along the inclined path (physical phenomenon). This is due to the gravitational force (input), which activates the gravity effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the ball has some mass (organ).

The reciprocator (part) reciprocates within the guide ways (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of smooth surface between the guide ways and the reciprocator (organ).

The balls (part) are separated (physical phenomenon). This is due to the reciprocating motion of the reciprocator (input), which activates the resistance to motion effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the projections are strong enough to resist the motion of the balls (organ).
