SUMMARY
$
This is can be used to transmit power between the two parallel shafts which have an offset. This mechanism can be interpreted as change of state from rest to rotation 
of the output shaft. 

The member (part) mounted on the input shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the member mounted on it (organ).


The cross piece (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the member mounted on the input shaft (input), which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the member and the cross piece (organ).
