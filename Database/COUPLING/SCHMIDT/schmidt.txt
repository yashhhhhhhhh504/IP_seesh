FUNCTION

$
The Schmidt coupling can adapt to wide variations in axial displacement while it is running under load.
Applications for this coupling include fields like automotive, marine, machine tool, and rolling mill machinery (see drawings).
$


STRUCTURE

$
An unorthodox yet remarkably simple arrangement of links and disks forms the basis of a versatile parallel-shaft coupling. This coupling comprises essentially three disks rotating in unison and interconnected in series by six links (see drawing). 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The inventor of the coupling, Richard Schmidt of Madison, Alabama, said that a similar link arrangement had been known to some German engineers for years. But those engineers were discouraged from applying the theory because they erroneously assumed that the centre disk had to be retained by its own bearing. Actually, Schmidt found that the centre disk is free to assume its own centre of rotation. In operation, all three disks rotate with equal velocity. 
The bearing-mounted connections of links to disks are equally paced at 120° on pitch circles of the same diameter. The distance between shafts can be varied steplessly between zero (when the shafts are in line) and a maximum that is twice the length of the links (see drawings.) There is no phase shift between shafts while the coupling is undulating.
Changes in radial displacement do not affect the constant-velocity relationship between the input and output shafts, nor do they affect initial radial reaction forces that might cause imbalance in the system. Those features open up unusual applications for it in automotive, marine, machine tool, and rolling-mill machinery (see drawings).

Parallel-link connections between disks exactly duplicate the motion between the input and output shafts and is the basis of this principle in coupling. The diagrams 02, 03 and 04 show three positions of the links as one shaft is shifted with respect to the other shaft in the system. Fig 02 illustrates the maximum displacement position of the coupling while Fig 03 illustrates the Zero displacement position. The midway position is depicted in Fig 04.
Torque transmitted by three links in the group adds up to a constant value, regardless of the angle of rotation as shown in Fig 05

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to transmit motion between two parallel misaligned shafts. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation of the outer member mounted on the output shaft. This can be described as follows:

The input member (part) mounted on output shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the outer member (organ).

The floating member (part) rotates in the same direction and also with the same velocity as that of the input member (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input member (input), which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input member and the floating member (organ), which is actually achieved by connecting the two with the help of links.


The output member (part) that is mounted on the output shaft rotates in the same direction as that of the floating member (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the floating member (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the output member and the floating member (organ) which is actually achieved by connecting the two the with the help of links.
