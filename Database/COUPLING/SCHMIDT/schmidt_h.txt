SUMMARY
$
This can be used to transmit motion between two parallel misaligned shafts. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation of the outer member mounted on the output shaft. This can be described as follows:

The input member (part) mounted on output shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the outer member (organ).

The floating member (part) rotates in the same direction and also with the same velocity as that of the input member (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input member (input), which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input member and the floating member (organ), which is actually achieved by connecting the two with the help of links.


The output member (part) that is mounted on the output shaft rotates in the same direction as that of the floating member (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the floating member (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the output member and the floating member (organ) which is actually achieved by connecting the two the with the help of links.
