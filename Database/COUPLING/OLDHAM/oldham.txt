FUNCTION

$
The distinguishing feature of an Oldham coupling is that it provides an exceptional flexibility and a wide range of parallel and misalignment capability. An Oldham coupling provides motion at a constant velocity as its central member describes a circle.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Oldham couplings consist of three members. A floating member is trapped by 90° displaced grooves between the two outer members, which connect to the drive shafts as shown in the figure. The shaft offset can vary, but the shafts must remain parallel. A small amount of axial freedom is possible.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
Oldham couplings can accommodate lateral shaft misalignments up to 10% of nominal shaft diameters and up to 3 angular misalignments. A tilt in the central member can occur because of the offset of the slots. This can be eliminated by enlarging its diameter and milling the slots in the same transverse plane.
Lubrication is a problem but can in most applications be overcome by choosing a coupling that uses a wear resistant plastic or an elastomer in place of steel or bronze floating members.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to connect two parallel shafts and to transmit power between the two. It can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. It can be described as follows:


The outer member (part) mounted on the input shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom (organ).

The floating member (part) rotates in the same direction (physical phenomenon). This due to the rotation of the outer member (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the floating member and the outer member which is achieved by maintaining friction between the floating member and the outer member  (organ).


The outer member (part) mounted on the output shaft rotates in the same direction as that of the floating member (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the floating member (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the floating member and the outer member (organ).
