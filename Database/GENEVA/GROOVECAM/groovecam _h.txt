SUMMARY
$
This can be used to generate intermittent motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to small angular rotation. This can be described as follows:

The input link (part) rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the input link (organ).

The roller follower (part) slides along the groove of the stationary cam (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input link (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth surface between the roller follower and the groove surface (organ).

The driving roller (part) slides in the slot of the output Geneva as it rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input link (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth surface between the driving surface and the slot of the output Geneva (organ).

The output Geneva (part) rotates intermittently (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the driving roller (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time”  (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied by the driving roller is sufficient to overcome the inertia of the output Geneva (organ).
