FUNCTION

$
This type of geneva drive is used when unequal durations are required for the motion and dwell periods.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This geneva drive consists of an output geneva wheel and an input drive with two input cranks positioned asymmetrically. Both the input and output shaft lie on the same axis. The geneva wheel and the input drive are mounted on a base frame.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The duration of the dwell periods is changed by arranging the driving rollers asymmetrically around the input shaft. This does not affect the duration of the motion periods. If unequal motion periods and unequal dwell periods are desired, the roller crank-arms must be unequal in length and the star must be suitably modified. This mechanism is called an irregular geneva drive.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate irregular intermittent motion. This can also interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The input Geneva wheel (part) rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the input wheel (organ).

The crank (part) mounted on the input wheel rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input wheel (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input wheel and the crank (organ).

The pin (part) mounted on the input crank slides in the slot provided on the output Geneva (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input crank (input) and requires the presence of a smooth surface between the pin and the slot surface (organ).

The pin (part) mounted on the input crank rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input crank and the pin (organ).

 The output wheel (part) rotates intermittently (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the pin mounted on the input crank (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied by the pin on the input crank is sufficient to over come the inertia of the output wheel (organ).
