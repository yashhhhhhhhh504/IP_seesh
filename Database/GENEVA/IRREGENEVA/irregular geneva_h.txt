SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate irregular intermittent motion. This can also interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The input Geneva wheel (part) rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the input wheel (organ).

The crank (part) mounted on the input wheel rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input wheel (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input wheel and the crank (organ).

The pin (part) mounted on the input crank slides in the slot provided on the output Geneva (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input crank (input) and requires the presence of a smooth surface between the pin and the slot surface (organ).

The pin (part) mounted on the input crank rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input crank and the pin (organ).

 The output wheel (part) rotates intermittently (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the pin mounted on the input crank (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied by the pin on the input crank is sufficient to over come the inertia of the output wheel (organ).
