SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate intermittent rotation. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The wheel A (part) rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and wheel A (organ).

The wheel B (part) rotates intermittently (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of pin mounted on the wheel A (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the smooth sliding surface between the slot on the wheel B and the pin on the wheel A (organ).
