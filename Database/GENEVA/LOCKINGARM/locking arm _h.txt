SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate intermittent motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to small angular rotation. This can be described as follows:

The cam (part) rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the cam (organ).

The input link (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the cam (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input link and cam (organ).

The driving roller (part) slides in the slot of the output wheel (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input link (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth surface between the driving roller and the slot on the output wheel (organ).


The output wheel (part) undergoes a small angular rotation (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the driving roller (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied by the driving roller is sufficient enough to overcome the inertia of the output wheel (organ).
