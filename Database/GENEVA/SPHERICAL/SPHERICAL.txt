FUNCTION

$
This mechanism provides intermittent motion between two shafts at right angles to each other.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The driver wheel consists of a handle for turning and an arm that fits into the slot of the driven wheel. Alternatively, the driver wheel can also be driven by a motor. The driven wheel's structure is similar to that of a spherical bowl, with four slots cut into it at right angles to each other. The axis of the geneva drive is perpendicular to that of the input drive.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The driver rotates continuously and during each rotation, the arm enters a slot of the driven wheel, providing it rotation as it does so. Thus there is a duration of dwell for exactly 180º of driver rotation. The animation illustrates the working of a spherical geneva.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism provides intermittent motion between two shafts at right angles to each other. This can also be interpreted as a change of state from rest to small angular rotation. This can be described as follows:

The driver wheel (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to torque applied by the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the driver wheel (organ).

The arm of the driving wheel (part) slides in the slot of the output Geneva (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the driver wheel (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth surface between the slot and the arm (organ).

The output Geneva (part) rotates in the horizontal plane through a small angle (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the arm (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied by the arm is sufficient enough to overcome the inertial of output Geneva (organ).
