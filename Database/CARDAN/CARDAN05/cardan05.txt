FUNCTION

$
Invented by Girolamo Cardano in the 16th century the Cardan gear is a way of converting rotary motion into straight line motion. This mechanism can be used to provide reciprocating motion along a straight line to operate a valve.
$


STRUCTURE

$
An eccentric drive gives rotation to the input rod, which is connected to it. The end of this rod is connected to a circular segment. The segment rocks on another circular surface. The radius of the circular segment is half that of the radius of the circular surface on which it rocks. The input and output rods are each attached to points on the small circle, that is, the ends of the small circular segment. The output rod, which has a valve attached to it, reciprocates in a slot cut in the larger circular segment.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
A valve drive demonstrates how the Cardan principle can be applied. A segment of the smaller circle rocks back and forth on the circular segment whose radius is twice as large. Both the points at which the input and output rods are attached to the small circle segment, describe straight lines. The guide of the valve rod prevents the rocking member from slipping.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate straight-line motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to straight-line motion. This can be described as follows:

The rod 1 (part) rotates eccentrically about the hinged point (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied (input) by the input shaft, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the rod (organ).

The circular segment (part) rocks on another circular surface (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input rod (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the rod and the circular segment (organ).

The ends (part) of the circular segment move along a straight-line motion (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rocking motion of the circular segment (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the radius of the circular segment is half of the circular surface (organ).
