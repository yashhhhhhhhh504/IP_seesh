SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate straight-line motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to straight-line motion. This can be described as follows:

The rod 1 (part) rotates eccentrically about the hinged point (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied (input) by the input shaft, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the rod (organ).

The circular segment (part) rocks on another circular surface (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input rod (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the rod and the circular segment (organ).

The ends (part) of the circular segment move along a straight-line motion (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rocking motion of the circular segment (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the radius of the circular segment is half of the circular surface (organ).
