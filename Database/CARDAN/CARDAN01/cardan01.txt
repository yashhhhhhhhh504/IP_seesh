FUNCTION

$
Invented by Girolamo Cardano in the 16th century the Cardan gear is a way of converting rotary motion into straight line motion.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The cardan mechanism consists basically of two gears. The outer gear has a diameter exactly twice as large as the inner gear.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
Cardan gearing works on the principle that any point on the periphery of a circle rolling on the inside of another circle describes, in general, a hypocycloid. This curve degenerates into a true straight line (diameter of the larger circle) if the diameters of both circles are in the ratio of 1:2. The rotation of the input shaft causes a small gear to roll round the inside of the fixed gear. A pin located on the pitch circle of the small gear describes a straight line. Its linear displacement is proportional to the theoretically true sine or cosine of the angle through which the input shaft is rotated.

SUMMARY

$

This mechanism can be used to generate straight line motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to straight line motion. This can be described as follows:

The input link (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the input link (organ).

The internal gear (part) rotates and revolves within the fixed outer gear (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input link (input) which activated the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree freedom between the input link and the internal gear (organ).

The pin (part) on the internal gear moves along a straight line (physical phenomenon). This is due to the revolution of the internal gear (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the pin is suitably mounted on the internal gear (organ).
