SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to generate straight line motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to straight line motion. This can be described as follows:

The input link (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the input link (organ).

The internal gear (part) rotates and revolves within the fixed outer gear (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input link (input) which activated the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree freedom between the input link and the internal gear (organ).

The pin (part) on the internal gear moves along a straight line (physical phenomenon). This is due to the revolution of the internal gear (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the pin is suitably mounted on the internal gear (organ).
