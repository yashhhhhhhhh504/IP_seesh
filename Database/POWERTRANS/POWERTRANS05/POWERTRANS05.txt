FUNCTION

$
This device is also used to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft, whose axes are perpendicular to each other, using two idle pulleys in between the drive and driven pulleys.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The device contains total 4 pulleys, and a rope. One pulley is mounted on drive shaft and one pulley is mounted on driven shaft. Remaining two pulleys are idle or guide pulleys. The rope is connected to drive and driven pulleys through guide pulleys. As shown in the figure, links 1, 4 are drive and driven pulleys respectively, and links 2, 3 are guide pulleys.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The pulley gets the torque from the drive shaft, to which it is connected. The pulley pulls the rope wrapped around it because of the frictional force created between shaft and pulley. The rope in turn produces the tangential force at the surface of the drum, which creates a torque on the drum. Thus the drum rotates and it in turn rotates the output shaft. The device shown in the figure is with a crossed belt. An open belt may be used, but the crossed one is preferable, as it gives more surface of contact.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to transmit power between the two shafts whose axes are perpendicular each other. This can be described as follows:


The pulley 1 (part) rotates in a vertical plane (phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the pulley (organ)


The belt or the rope (part) moves in a linear direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the friction between the pulley surface and the belt (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of tight surface contact between the pulley surface and the belt (organ), which is accomplished by the use of idler pulleys 2 and 3.

The pulley 4 (part) rotates in a horizontal plane (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the belt (input), which activates friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of tension in the belt (organ).
