SUMMARY
$
This can be used to transmit power between the two shafts whose axes are perpendicular each other. This can be described as follows:


The pulley 1 (part) rotates in a vertical plane (phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the pulley (organ)


The belt or the rope (part) moves in a linear direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the friction between the pulley surface and the belt (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of tight surface contact between the pulley surface and the belt (organ), which is accomplished by the use of idler pulleys 2 and 3.

The pulley 4 (part) rotates in a horizontal plane (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the belt (input), which activates friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of tension in the belt (organ).
