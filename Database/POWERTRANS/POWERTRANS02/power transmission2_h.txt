SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to transmit power from one shaft to another by using simple pulleys and a belt or rope, and is called a crossed belt drive. This can be described as follows:

The driver pulley (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input) which 
activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degrees of freedom between the pulley and the input shaft (organ).

The rope or the belt wrapped around the pulley (part) moves in the linear direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pulley (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction between the pulley and the belt and the rope (organ).


The driven pulley (part) rotates in the opposite direction as that of the driven pulley (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the belt (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of tension in the belt (organ).
