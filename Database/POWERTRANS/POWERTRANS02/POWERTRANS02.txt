FUNCTION

$
This device is used to transmit power from one shaft to another by using simple pulleys and a belt or rope, and is called a crossed belt drive. In this case the two shafts rotate in different directions.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The kinematic structure contains two pulleys and a belt or rope. The pulleys are mounted on two different shafts, which are parallel to each other. A flat pulley is used in case of a belt drive and a grooved pulley in case of rope drive or v-belt drive. Due to the setup, the belt is twisted in the middle and looks like the figure 8. The belt runs around the two pulleys on either side of the twist. As shown in the figure, links 1, 3 are pulleys and link 2 is either a belt or a rope.  
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The pulley 1 gets the torque from the shaft to which it is connected. The pulley pulls the belt wrapped around it because of the frictional force created between the shaft and the pulley. The belt in turn produces the tangential force at the rim of the pulley 2 diagonally opposite to the contact point with pulley 1. This tangential force creates a torque on the pulley 2 in the opposite direction to pulley 1 so that the pulley rotates and in turn rotates the output shaft. The efficiency of power transmission is high in crossed belt drives because the angle of contact between the pulleys and the belt is more than 180 degrees.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to transmit power from one shaft to another by using simple pulleys and a belt or rope, and is called a crossed belt drive. This can be described as follows:

The driver pulley (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input) which 
activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degrees of freedom between the pulley and the input shaft (organ).

The rope or the belt wrapped around the pulley (part) moves in the linear direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pulley (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction between the pulley and the belt and the rope (organ).


The driven pulley (part) rotates in the opposite direction as that of the driven pulley (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the belt (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of tension in the belt (organ).


$
