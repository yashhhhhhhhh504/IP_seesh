FUNCTION

$
This device is used to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft, whose axes are perpendicular to each other. There is no idle pulley in this mechanism.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The device contains pulley, drum and a closed belt. The pulley is mounted on drive shaft and the drum is fixed to the driven shaft. The belt is twisted through 90 degrees and is connected to pulley and drum. As shown in the figure, links 1, 2 are pulley, drum respectively and link 3 is a belt. The axes of the pulley and the drum are perpendicular to each other.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The pulley gets the torque from the shaft to which it is connected. The pulley pulls the belt wrapped around it because of the frictional force created between the shaft and the pulley. The belt in turn produces the tangential force at the surface of the drum, which creates a torque on the drum. Therefore the drum rotates and in turn it rotates the output shaft.

SUMMARY
$
This device is used to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft, whose axes are perpendicular to each other. This can be described as follows:


The driver pulley (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between input shaft and the pulley (organ).

The belt (part) moves linearly (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pulley (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction between the surfaces of the pulley and the belt (organ).


The drum (part) whose axis is at 90 degrees to the axis of the driver pulley (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the belt (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of tension in the belt (organ).
$



ACTION
$
 
 Using this device power and motion can be transmitted between two shafts, which are perpendicular to each other even in the absence of idler pulley.
