
SUMMARY
$
This device is used to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft, whose axes are perpendicular to each other. This can be described as follows:


The driver pulley (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between input shaft and the pulley (organ).

The belt (part) moves linearly (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pulley (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction between the surfaces of the pulley and the belt (organ).


The drum (part) whose axis is at 90 degrees to the axis of the driver pulley (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the belt (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of tension in the belt (organ).
