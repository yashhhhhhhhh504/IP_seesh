FUNCTION

$
The key to manual transmission is the mechanism that selects the gear ratio. This is where the shifter's "H" pattern on most transmission comes from.
When you select a gear, the transmission engages one of the freewheeling gears to the output shaft, and this picks the gear ratio. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The output shaft is splined. Between each pair of gears on the output shaft is a collar that can slide along the splines. The collar has a set of teeth along the side that can mesh into the side of a freewheeling gear.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
When you put the car into gear, you are sliding one of these collars into one of the gears on the output shaft. As collars slides into a gear, the teeth on the collar, called dog teeth, fit into holes on the sides of the gear, locking it to the output shaft.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to operate the engine in the power band. This can be described as follows:

The gear (part) mounted on the lay shaft rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the gear mounted on the input shaft (input), which activates the “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time”  (physical effect) and requires the presence of meshing between the gears (organ).

The lay shaft (part) rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the gear mounted on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the gear and the lay shaft (organ).

The gears (part) mounted on the output shaft rotate (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the gears mounted on the lay shaft (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same” (physical effect) and requires the presence of meshing between the gears (organ).

The shift lever (part) is operated (physical phenomenon). This is due to the manual force (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the lever and the frame (organ).

The collar (part) meshes with one of the gears mounted on the output shaft (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the selector rod (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the collar and the selector rod and it is also necessary that the output shaft is splined (organ). 


The output shaft (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the gear with which the collar has been meshed with (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom gear and the output shaft (organ).
