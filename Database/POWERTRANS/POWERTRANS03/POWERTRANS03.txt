FUNCTION

$
This device is used to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft, whose axes are perpendicular to each other. In this case, if the axis and direction of drive shaft is assumed as anticlockwise with respect to X-axis, then the driven shaft rotates in the clockwise direction with respect to the Z-axis.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The device consists of 2 pulleys, a drum and a rope. One pulley is mounted on the drive shaft while the other is just an idler pulley. The rope is twisted through 90 degrees and is connected to the pulley and drum. The idle pulley is pressed against the rope and is mounted on idle shaft, which is parallel to drive shaft. As shown in the figure, links 1, 2 are pulleys, link 3 is a rope and link 4 is a drum.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The pulley 1 gets the torque from the shaft to which it is connected. The pulley pulls the rope wrapped around it because of the frictional force created between the shaft and the pulley. The rope in turn produces the tangential force at the surface of the drum. This tangential force creates a torque on the drum, so that the drum rotates and in turn it rotates the output shaft. The efficiency of power transmission is high in this case because the surface of contact will be increased by the smaller idle or guide pulley.

SUMMARY
$
This device is used to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft, whose axes are perpendicular to each other. This device can be described as follows:

The driver pulley (part) being mounted on the input shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the driver pulley (organ).

The rope (part) wrapped around the driver pulley moves in the linear direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pulley (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction surface between the pulley and the rope (organ).


The drum (part) whose axis is at 90 degrees to the axis of the driver pulley rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the rope (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of tension in the rope (organ).
