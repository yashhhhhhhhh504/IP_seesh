Summary
{
This mechanism generates an approximate straight line motion  in the following steps:

Link BC is connected to the frame by a revolute pair (Structure). Link BC is made to rotate partially (Physical Phenomenon) by applying a torque to it (Input), activating Newtonian Laws of Motion (Physical Effect). This partial rotation occurs as there exists the zero degree of freedom of motion in the direction of motion (Organ)

All the links in this mechanism are connected to each other by revolute joints (Structure) and the requirements are that AB = BC; AD = AE; and CD, DF, FE, EC be equal (Structure). The rotation of Link BC (Input) activates Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) resulting in the expansion of ADFE / contraction of CDEF (Physical Phenomenon) made possible due to ratio of lengths of the links (Organ)

All the links in this mechanism are connected to each other by revolute joints (Structure) and the requirements are that AB = BC; AD = AE; and CD, DF, FE, EC be equal (Structure). The rotation of Link BC (Input) activates Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) resulting in the contraction of ADFE / expansion of CDEF (Physical Phenomenon) made possible due to ratio of lengths of the links (Organ) and the single degree of freedom of motion of the links of the mechanism (Organ)
