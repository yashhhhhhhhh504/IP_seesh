FUNCTION

$

This mechanism is known as a Simplified Watt's Linkage. This mechanism converts rotary to straight-line motion without the need for guides.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This is a simple four bar mechanism in which links are connected by only revolute pairs. Actually it is a rocker-rocker four-bar mechanism. The coupler link is the smallest link, which can make a complete revolution with respect to Arm 1 and Arm 2 as shown in the figure.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
A simplified Watt's linkage generates an approximate straight line motion. If the two arms are of equal length, the tracing point describes a symmetrical figure 8 with an almost straight line throughout the stroke length. The straightest and longest stroke occurs when the connecting link length is about two thirds of the stroke, and arm length is 1.5 times the stroke length. Offset 'h', should equal half the connecting link length (a+b). If the arms are unequal, one branch of the figure 8 curve is straighter than the other. It is straightest when a/b equals Arm 2/Arm 1.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism generates an approximate straight line motion  in the following steps:

Arm 1 is connected to the frame by a revolute pair (part). Arm 1 is made to oscillate (Physical Phenomenon) by applying a torque to it (Input), activating Newtonian Laws of Motion (Physical Effect). This oscillation occurs as there exists a single degree of freedom of motion in the direction of motion (Organ)

Arm 1 is attached to one end of the connecting link by a revolute joint, while the other end forms a revolute pair with Arm 2 (part). The oscillation of Arm 1 (Input) activates Newtonian Laws of motion (Physical Effect) resulting in the oscillation of Arm 2 (Physical Phenomenon) made possible due to the connecting link (Organ)

This combined oscillation (Input) activated by Newtonian Laws of Motion (Physical Effect) result in the tracing point on the connecting link describing an almost straight line along the entire stroke (Physical Phenomenon). This is due to the position of the tracing point (Organ) and the connecting link forms a revolute pair with the arms (part)
