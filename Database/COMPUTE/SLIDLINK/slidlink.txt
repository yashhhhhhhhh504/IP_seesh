FUNCTION

$
Analog computing mechanisms are capable of almost instantaneous response to minute variations in input. This mechanism is capable of performing addition and subtraction, based on the differential principle.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This computing mechanism consists of 2 input links ‘x’ and ‘y’, and an output link ‘z’. The longitudinal axis of ‘z’ and those of ‘x’ and ‘y’ lie in the same plane, and are parallel to each other. The output shaft ‘z’ is pivoted at the center of the horizontal link 'a', perpendicular to it. The links ‘x’ and ‘y’ form sliding pairs with the horizontal link 'a'. A tension spring is made use of to bring the link ‘z’ back to the neutral position. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
This mechanism is of the type where the inputs translate two links. This mechanism can solve the equation z = c(x ± y), where 'c' is the scale factor, 'x' and 'y' are inputs and 'z' is the output. The motion of 'x' and 'y' in the same direction performs addition, while in the opposite direction it performs subtraction.
Consider ‘x’ and ‘y’ both moving by 5 units in the upward direction. Therefore even ‘z’ moves upwards by 5 units. Or z = 5 = 0.5(5 + 5), where the scaling factor ‘c’ = 0.5.
Similarly if ‘x’ moves by 5 units upwards and ‘y’ moves in the downward direction by 5 units, then the position of ‘z’ remains unaffected, z = 0 = 0.5(5 – 5).

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to perform computation. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to sliding motion. This can be described as follows:

The input link x (part) slides in the vertical direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the applied force is greater than the gravitational force (organ).

The input link y (part) slides in the vertical direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied is greater than the gravitational force (organ).

The output link z (part) slides in the vertical direction in accordance to the law z=c(x+y) (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the links x and y (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the link z is hinged at the center of the link a (organ).
