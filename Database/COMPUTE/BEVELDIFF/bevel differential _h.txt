SUMMARY
$
This device can be used for computation. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. this can be described as follows:

The input spur gear x (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the  spur gear (organ).

The spur gear y (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the  spur gear (organ).

The bevel gear z (part) rotates as per the equation z=c(x ± y) (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the two bevel gears (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the meshing between the bevel gears and bevel gear z (organ).
