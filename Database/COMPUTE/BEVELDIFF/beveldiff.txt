FUNCTION

$
Analog computing mechanisms are capable of almost instantaneous response to minute variations in input. This mechanism is capable of performing addition and subtraction, based on the differential principle.
$


STRUCTURE

$
As the name suggests, this computing mechanism comprises mainly of a bevel gear differential and four spur gears. Gears 'x' and 'y' are the input gears, while 'z' is the output.
The input gear 'x' meshes with another spur gear, which is joined to a bevel gear by a shaft. The other input gear 'y' is also used to drive a bevel gear in the same fashion, except that the shaft connecting the spur gear and the bevel gear is hollow. The output shaft is coupled to the third bevel gear and passes through the hollow shaft of the spur gear - bevel gear combination.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
This mechanism is of the type where the inputs rotate shafts. This mechanism can solve the equation z = c(x ± y), where 'c' is the scale factor, 'x' and 'y' are inputs and 'z' is the output. The motion of 'x' and 'y' in the same direction performs addition, while in the opposite direction it performs subtraction.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used for computation. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. this can be described as follows:

The input spur gear x (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the  spur gear (organ).

The spur gear y (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the  spur gear (organ).

The bevel gear z (part) rotates as per the equation z=c(x ± y) (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the two bevel gears (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the meshing between the bevel gears and bevel gear z (organ).
