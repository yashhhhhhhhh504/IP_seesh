SUMMARY
$
This can be used to perform computation. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to oscillating motion. This can be described as follows:

The link x (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the link x is hinged to the surface (organ).

The link y (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the link y is hinged to the surface (organ).

The link z (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the oscillation of the links x and y (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the link z is hinged to the surface (organ).
