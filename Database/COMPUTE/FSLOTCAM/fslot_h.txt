SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to perform computation. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to sliding motion. This can be described as follows: 

The slide x (part) slides in the guide ways (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force (input) applied on it which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of frictionless surface between the slide and the guide ways (organ).

The link 1 (part) rotates with the respect the slide x (physical phenomenon). This is due to the sliding motion of slide x (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of a hinged joint between the link 1 and the slide x (organ).

The joint (part) between the links 1 and 2 slides in the slot which follows the curve y=f(x) (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the links 1 and 2 (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the slide y slides in the guide ways provided for it (organ).
