FUNCTION

$
Analog computing mechanisms are capable of almost instantaneous response to minute variations in input. This functional generator, called a reciprocal cam, is capable of converting a number into its reciprocal. This simplifies division by permitting simple multiplication between a numerator and its denominator.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This functional generator consists of an input gear, a slotted cam and a follower pin as shown in the figure.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The cam is rotated to a position corresponding to the denominator. The distance between the center of the cam and the center of the follower pin corresponds to the reciprocal.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to calculate the reciprocal of a number. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to reciprocating motion. This can be described as follows:

The slotted cam (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input gear (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of meshing between the input gear and the slotted cam (organ0.

The follower pin (part) reciprocates as well as slides in the slot of the cam (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of cam (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can same occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the slot and the follower pin (organ).

The distance between the center of the cam and the center of the pin gives the reciprocal of the number to which the cam is pointing.
