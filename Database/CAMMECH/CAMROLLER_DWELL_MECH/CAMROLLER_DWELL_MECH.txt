FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used to punch on steel strips, which roll on rollers.

$


STRUCTURE

$

It consists of two rollers on which the steel strips moves linearly.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The linear movement of the shaft causes the steel strip to dwell and during this time the punch is forced against the steel strip.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to punch on a steel strip that is moving over two rotating rollers. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to reciprocating motion. This can be described as follows:

The rollers (part) rotate (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the roller (organ).

The steel strip (part) moves linearly over the rollers (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the rollers (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and it requires the presence of friction surface between the steel strip and the roller (organ).

The steel strip (part) dwells as it moves linearly over the rollers (physical phenomenon). This is due to the linear motion of the shaft of the second roller (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the shaft of the second roller is allowed to slide smoothly along the guide ways (organ).
 
The punch (part) presses against the steel strip (physical phenomenon). This is due to the downward motion of the punch (input), which activates the punching effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the steel strip dwells for an appropriate amount time (organ).
