FUNCTION

$
Swash Plate cams are feasible for light loads only, such as in a pump. The cam's eccentricity produces forces that cause excessive loads. Multiple followers can ride on a plate, thereby providing smooth pumping action for a multipiston pump.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The cam in this case is basically a disk mounted on the driving shaft, at an angle with respect to the horizontal plane. The follower rides on the disk at an offset distance.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
As the shaft rotates, the cam rotates along with it. This rotary motion of the cam causes the follower to reciprocate vertically. The follower's motion can also be controlled by varying its radial position on the cam surface. This mechanism can also accommodate multiple followers.

SUMMARY
$

This mechanism can be used to generate reciprocating motion. This can be interpreted as a change of state from the absence of torque at the input shaft to the presence of torque at the input shaft. The whole process can be accomplished in a series of  steps as described below :


The cam (part) mounted on the input shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque (input) applied by the input torque, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between cam and the input shaft (organ).

The roller of the follower (part) rotates continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation (input) of the cam, which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between the roller of the follower and the cam (organ).

The follower (part) reciprocates (physical phenomenon) in the guide ways. This is due to the rotation (input) of the 
cam, which activates the law “ no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time “ (physical effect) and requires the angular setting of the cam (organ).


Since the adjustable follower (part) forms a sliding pair with the cam, the position of the roller can be changed (physical phenomenon) with respect to the center of the cam. This is achieved by applying a force (input) on the follower, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect).

There is contact between the follower and the cam (part). Thus as the position of the follower on the cam is changed (input), there is change in the distance between the follower and the center of the cam (organ). This activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and thus the length of the reciprocation changes (physical phenomenon).
