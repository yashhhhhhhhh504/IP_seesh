FUNCTION

$

This mechanism can be used to open car hood.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This mechanism employs a 4 bar chain. It consists of 4 links. One of the links is fixed. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
In this mechanism one of the links is given the input.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to open car hood. This can be interpreted as a change of state from closed car hood to open car hood. This can be described as follows:

The crank (part) rotates about the hinge (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the crank (organ).

The connecting rod (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time,” (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the crank and the connecting rod (organ). 

The car door, which forms a part of the connecting rod, opens.
