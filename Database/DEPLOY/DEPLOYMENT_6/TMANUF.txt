FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used as a deployment mechanism.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This mechanism consists of a circular segment at the center and a number of links hinged to it at the periphery.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The rotation is given to the circular segment. The other links move due to the rotation of the circular disc.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to increase area. This can be interpreted as a change of state from small area to large area. This can be described as follows:

The circular disc (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the circular disc (organ).

The links (part) rotate with respect to circular disk and become radial with respect to the circular disk and thus increase the area (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the circular disk (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the circular disk and the links (organ).
