FUNCTION

$
This mechanism employs a 4 bar chain. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
This mechanism consists of rigid links. The links are connected by hinged joints.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The link, which receives the input and undergoes one complete rotation, is called the crank. The follower rocks about the hinged point. The link that connects the input link to the output link is called the connecting rod.

SUMMARY
$
This can mechanism can be used to the increase height of the table. This is can be interpreted as a change of state from small height to large height. This can be described as follows:

The crank (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to torque applied on to it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of the zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the crank (organ).

The connecting rod (part) oscillates and thus increases in height (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the crank (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the crank and connecting rod (organ).
