FUNCTION

$
This is compact form of the normal personal computer. This can be folded and can reduced in the area that it occupies when not in use and it can be deployed for use.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of two parts. One of the parts is monitor and the other is keyboard. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The monitor is made to open by making it rotate with respect to the keyboard and this is assisted by the presence of a hinged joint between the monitor and the keyboard.
