FUNCTION

$
In the screw press a screw spindle is rotated in a fixed nut, whereby a longitudinal force is developed in the spindle, one end of which thrusts against the work piece laid under it.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a flywheel, two friction wheels and spindle.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The upper end of the spindle is provided with a large flywheel, which when rotating contains large reserve of energy of stored up energy. This energy is transmitted through the spindle to the work piece. The flywheel is driven by a friction wheel. Refraction is effected by another friction wheel, which drives the flywheel in the opposite direction.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to compress and shape components by exerting a high pressure on them. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to reciprocating motion. This can be described as follows:

The flywheel (part) rotates in the clockwise direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tangential force (input) applied by the rotating pressing wheel, which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and it requires the presence of friction surface between the flywheel and the pressing wheel (organ).

The screw spindle (part) moves in the downward direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the flywheel in clockwise direction (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the screw spindle and the flywheel (organ).

The work piece (part) is formed onto the shape of the die (physical phenomenon). This is due to the downward movement of the screw spindle (input) which activates the law “ no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the material is stressed beyond it elastic limit (organ).

The flywheel (part) rotates in the counter clockwise direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tangential force applied by the rotating lifting wheel (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and it requires the presence of friction surface between the flywheel and the lifting wheel (organ).

The screw spindle (part) is retracted (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the flywheel (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the screw spindle and the flywheel (organ).
