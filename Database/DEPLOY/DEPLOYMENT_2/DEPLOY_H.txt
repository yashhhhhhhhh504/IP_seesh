
SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to deploy. This can be described as follows:

The hollow solid object (part) is folded (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the force is large enough to overcome the elastic force (organ).


The hollow solid object (part) unfolds (physical phenomenon). This is due to the elastic force (input) which activates the hooks law (physical effect) and requires the presence of elastic material within the hollow solid material (organ).
