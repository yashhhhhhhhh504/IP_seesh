SUMMARY
$
This is used to store important things. This can be described as follows:

One of the overlapping parts of the wallet (part) is unfolded (physical phenomenon). This is due to the unwrapping force applied on it (input), which activates the rotation effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of a soft and flexible material between the two parts (organ).
