FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used for digging. This deploys the links, which serve as hand for the excavator.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of two straight links, which are connected by a hinged joint.  The output link is curved and cup shaped. It is this that makes the digging possible. The cup shaped output link is provided with claws.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
 The claws are ones, which actually make digging possible, and cup shaped, link collects the loose soil and transfers the loose soil into the truck.
