FUNCTION

$
This is usually used to provide shelter. The advantage with this is that it can be folded as it occupies very less space when folded it can easily carried to any place.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a flexible material. It also consists of rods to support the tent and also provide the required height. The material usually used is canvas and at each end of the material loops provided that can be bolted on to the ground.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The tent as in the folded state occupies less space and occupies a lot space when it is spread to provide shelter.
