FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used as a deployment structure.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of two plates at the end of the long structure, which consists of a number of links.

$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The force is applied on to one side of the mechanism, which will compress the structure in between the plates.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used as a deployment mechanism.
$

ACTION

$ 
 To deploy.
$

STATE

$
The mechanism is occupying less area.

The mechanism is occupying large area.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
Apply force at the ends of the structure.


 



$


PHYEFFECT

$
No two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time.




$


INPUT

$
Push force.




$


ORGAN

$
Necessary that the links have one degree of freedom between them.

$



PARTS
$
Links that form the structure in between the end plates.
