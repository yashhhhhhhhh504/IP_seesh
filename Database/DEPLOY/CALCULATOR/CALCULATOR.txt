FUNCTION

$
This is very good deployment structure and it can also be considered as a good locking mechanism.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of the calculator, which of course consists of a liquid crystal display and a keypad to key in the numbers and the special data. The liquid crystal display is of course is used to show results of the calculation. It also has covering flaps, which cover the sensitive calculator.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The cover of the calculator opens and exposes the calculator for use. This is accomplished by pressing a button provided which in turn will activate the shafts carrying the covering flaps and thus make them rotate about the axis of the shaft cause the exposure.
