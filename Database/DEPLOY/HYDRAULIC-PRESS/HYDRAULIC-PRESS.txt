FUNCTION

$

Hydraulic press has a function of compressing and shaping the components.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Hydraulic press has a function of compressing and shaping the components. It transmits power through fluids. It cylinder and piston arrangement, ram, worktable on which work piece is mounted. Due to fluid pressure ram goes down and gives an impact on work piece, which gets deformed.
$

BEHAVIOUR

$
Fluid exerts larger force on the ram. This is due to fluid pressure acting on the upper ram surface which actuates Pascal' law which requires ram surface which is in contact with power transmitting fluids to be greater than that of power transmitting input piston. Ram travels in downward direction. This is due to force acting on it, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion and requires smooth guide ways for ram and one degree of freedom. Work piece gets deformed. This is due to force exerted by the ram, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion and requires energy given by the ram to work piece greater than that required for starting deformation.

SUMMARY
$

Hydraulic press has a function of compressing and shaping the components. It transmits power through fluids. It cylinder and piston arrangement, ram, worktable on which work piece is mounted. Due to fluid pressure ram goes down and gives an impact on work piece, which gets deformed. It is explained below,

Fluid (part) exerts larger force on the ram (physical phenomenon). This is due to fluid pressure (input) acting on the upper ram surface which actuates Pascal' law (physical effect) which requires ram surface which is in contact with power transmitting fluids to be greater than that of power transmitting input piston (organ).

Ram (part) travels in downward direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to force acting on it (input), which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires smooth guide ways for ram and one degree of freedom (organ).

Work piece (part) gets deformed (physical phenomenon). This is due to force exerted (input) by the ram, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires energy given by the ram to work piece greater than that required for starting deformation (organ).
