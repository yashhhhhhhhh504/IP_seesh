FUNCTION

$
This component can actually used for connecting two parts temporarily. This can also be used as deployment.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a cylinder on which threads are cut. It also consists of a head whose diameter is greater than the diameter of the shank.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The screw is rotated and as it rotates it also moves linearly in the hole provided for it.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism is basically used for connecting two parts. This can also be used for deployment. This can be described as follows:

The shank (part) slides as it rotates into the hole provided (physical phenomenon). This is due to the couple applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the thread on the screw fits into the threads provided in the hole (organ).
