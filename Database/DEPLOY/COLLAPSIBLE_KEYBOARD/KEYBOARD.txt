FUNCTION

$
To make a roll from deployed state.
$



STRUCTURE

$
This type of keyboard can be rolled like a paper. In rolled or collapsed state it occupies small space. Also it can be cleaned in hot water of 60 degree Celsius. Basically it is designed for workshops, laboratories, and clinical workshops. It is made up of rubber, which is flexible. 
$



BEHAVIOUR

$
Rubber keyboard gets rolled to a collapsed state. This is due to force applied at one side and requires presence of flexible material. Material flexibility is key point in rolling. The cord is used as locking device in rolled state.

SUMMARY
$
This type of keyboard can be rolled like a paper. In rolled or collapsed state it occupies small space. Also it can be cleaned in hot water of 60 degree Celsius. Basically it is designed for workshops, laboratories, and clinical workshops. It is made up of rubber, which is flexible. The way by which it is rolled is explained below,

Rubber keyboard (part) gets rolled to a collapsed state (physical phenomenon). This is due to force applied at one side (input), which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires presence of flexible material (organ).
