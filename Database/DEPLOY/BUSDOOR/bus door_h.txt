SUMMARY
$
This mechanism is usually used in doors of buses. This can be interpreted as change of state from small area to large area. This can be discussed as follows:

The piston (part) reciprocates in the cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to force applied by the compressed air (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of smooth surface between the piston and the cylinder (organ).

The door (part) operates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the piston (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of contact of one degree of freedom between the doors and the piston (organ).
