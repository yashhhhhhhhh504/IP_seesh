FUNCTION

$
This device is used to punch nails into the walls with ease.
$


STRUCTURE

$
A solenoid is an electromagnetic coil with a sliding piston inside it. In a nail gun, the piston is made of magnetic material. When you apply current one way through the coil, the electromagnetic field repels the magnetic piston, pushing it out. But when you reverse the current, the polar orientation switches and the electromagnet draws the piston back in. Some solenoids have a spring mechanism to draw the piston back in. 

$
BEHAVIOUR

$
An electromagnetic nail gun uses such a solenoid as a hammer. When you pull the trigger: 
1. The electrical circuit runs the current through the electromagnet so that the piston extends downward. Typically, the piston is attached to a sturdy blade. 
2. The blade makes contact with the nail, forcing it out of the gun. 
3. At the bottom of the cylinder, the piston hits an electrical switch. 
4. Throwing this switch reverses the electrical current running through the electromagnet. The electromagnet draws the piston back in for another hit.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to punch nails into the walls. This can be interpreted as a change of state from nail outside the wall to nail inside the wall. This can be discussed as follows:

The trigger (part) is pressed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied is enough to the motion (organ).

The circuit (part) is completed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the trigger (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that it provides a path least optimum resistance (organ).

The current (part) passes through the circuit (physical phenomenon). This is due to the closed circuit (input), which activates the ohms law (physical effect) and it requires the presence of voltage difference (organ).

The magnetic field (part) is formed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the flow of electricity in the coil (input), which activates the electromagnetic effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the coil is tightly wound (organ).

The piston and blade (part) slides within the coil (physical phenomenon). This is due to the magnetic force (input), which activates the magnetic effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the piston and the blade have magnetic properties (organ).

The nail (part) is punched into the wall (physical phenomenon). This is due to the reciprocating motion of the piston and the blade (input), which activates the punching effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied is sufficient enough for the nail to penetrate into the wall (organ).
