FUNCTION

$
This mainly used to for transmission of television signals. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a number of rods that are placed parallel each other on common rod. The common rod is in turn connected to a vertical rod. The clarity of the relay depends on the accuracy with which common rod is pointing towards the relay station.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The antenna size is variable and it is also foldable. When not in use it can be folded and kept aside so that is doesn’t occupy large space.
