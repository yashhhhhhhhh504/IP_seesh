FUNCTION

$
These portable guns generate hammering power with internal combustion, the same force that keeps your car going
$


STRUCTURE

$
They have a long blade attached to a sliding piston, which is moved by an imbalance in atmospheric pressure.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
At the most basic level, combustion guns are a lot like pneumatic nailers. The piston moves downward when there is greater pressure above it, and it moves upward when there is greater pressure below it.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to punch nails into the walls. This can be interpreted as a change of state from nail outside the wall to nail inside the wall. This can be discussed as follows:

The barrel (part) is pressed against the wall surface (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of smooth surface between the barrel and the guide ways (organ).

The inlet valve (part) opens (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the barrel (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of smooth sliding surface between the valve and the guide ways (organ).

The inflammable gas (part) flows into the combustion zone (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure difference (input), which activates the Bernoulli's effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the pressure outside the cylinder is higher than the pressure inside the cylinder (organ).

The trigger (part) is pressed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied is sufficient enough to cause the motion (organ).

The gas (part) in the combustion zone is ignited (physical phenomenon). This is due to the electric spark generated (input), which activates the ignition effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the temperature produced is greater than or equal to the ignition temperature of the gas (organ).

The piston (part) reciprocates within the cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure exerted by the expanding gases (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of smooth surface between the piston and the cylinder (organ).

The nail (part) is punched into the wall (physical phenomenon). This is due to the reciprocating motion of the piston (input), which activates the law "no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time", (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied is sufficient enough to penetrate into the wall (organ).
