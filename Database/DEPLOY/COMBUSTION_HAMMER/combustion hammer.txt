FUNCTION

$
These portable guns generate hammering power with internal combustion, the same force that keeps your car going
$


STRUCTURE

$
They have a long blade attached to a sliding piston, which is moved by an imbalance in atmospheric pressure.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
At the most basic level, combustion guns are a lot like pneumatic nailers. The piston moves downward when there is greater pressure above it, and it moves upward when there is greater pressure below it.
