FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used to provide space for connection when in use and to close the space when not it use. This is accomplished by employing a sliding door.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a plastic door, which slides with respect to the plastic box. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
When connection has to be established then the cable has to be inserted into the space provided in the box. For this to be done the plastic door of the box is lifted with the help of the projection given to it.
