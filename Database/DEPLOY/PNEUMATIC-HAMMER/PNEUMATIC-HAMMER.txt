FUNCTION

$
It delivers a large number of blows in rapid succession. These blows are delivered by the piston, which moves to and fro in a cylinder and is worked by compressed air. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The device consists of control lever, diaphragm valve, piston, inner compartment, exhaust air compartment, air inlet and outer compartment. It also has a tool.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The compressed air is supplied through a hose from a compressor. When the inlet valve is opened by means of the lever mounted within the handle, the air flows through the diaphragm valve into the outer air compartment. The compressed air is thereby admitted to the top of the piston and forces it downwards, so that it strikes the upper end of the tool.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to deliver large number of blows in rapid successions. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to reciprocating motion. This can be described as follows:

The inlet valve (part) opens (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the lever (input) mounted within the handle of the hammer, which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between the valve and the lever (organ).

The compressed air (part) enters the outer compartment (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tilting of the diaphragm valve (input), which in turn is due to the pressure applied by the compressed air on the other side of the diaphragm valve, which activates the Bernoulli’s law (physical effect) and is necessary that the diaphragm valve is of convex type (organ).

The piston (part) moves in the upward direction thus compressing the air above the piston head (physical phenomenon). This is due to the upward force (input) applied by the compressed air, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of gap between the piston rod and the walls of the inner compartment (organ).

The diaphragm valve (input) tilts and the inlet to the inner compartment is open and the inlet to the outer compartment is closed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the upward force applied by the compressed air (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the upward force applied by the compressed air is greater than the downward force applied by the compressed air supplied by the hose (organ).

The piston (part) moves in the downward direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied by the compressed air (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth surface between the piston and the inner compartment walls (organ).
