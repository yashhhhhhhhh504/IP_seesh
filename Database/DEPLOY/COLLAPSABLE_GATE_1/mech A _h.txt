SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to vary the space occupied by the 
Cylinder.
$

ACTION

$ 
 To deploy.

To change area.
$

STATE

$
It is occupying less area.

It is occupying large area.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
Expand the expansion grills and hence increase the area occupied by the cylinder.

$


PHYEFFECT

$
Newtonian laws of motion.

$


INPUT

$
This is due to the force applied on it.




$


ORGAN

$
Necessary that the material of the cylinder.

$



PARTS
$
Expansion grill.
