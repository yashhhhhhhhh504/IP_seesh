FUNCTION

$
The fans are usually used to circulate air in living room. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
It is actually made up of a flexible material with a little stiffness. The fan is folded when not in use so that is occupies less space and it unfolded during use.

SUMMARY
$
This is mainly used to circulate air. The advantage of having a foldable one is that it occupies less space when not in use.


$

ACTION

$ 
 To circulate air.

$

STATE

$
Occupies less area when in folded state.

Occupies large area when in unfolded state.
$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
Unfold the fan.

Flap the unfolded fan

$


PHYEFFECT

$
Newtonian laws of motion.

No two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time.


$


INPUT

$
Unwrapping force.

Moment.

$


ORGAN

$
Necessary that the fan is made up of a flexible material.

Necessary that the fan material possesses the necessary stiffness to circulate the air.
