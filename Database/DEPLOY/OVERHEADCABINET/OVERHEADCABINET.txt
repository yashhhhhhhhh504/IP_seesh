FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used to open and close an overhead cabinet. This mechanism employs a 4 bar chain.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This mechanism employs a 4 bar chain and the cabinet forming the connecting rod of the mechanism.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The input is given to one of the links and the other links move relatively.

SUMMARY
$
To open an overhead cabinet. This can be interpreted as a change of state from closed to open overhead cabinet. This can be described as follows:

The crank (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to torque applied on to it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of the zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the crank (organ).

The cabinet that forms the connecting rod (part) oscillates and thus opens (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the crank (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the crank and connecting rod (organ).

ACTION

$ 
 To open an overhead cabinet.
$

STATE

$
The cabinet is closed.

The cabinet is open.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
The crank rotates.

The cabinet that forms a connecting rod oscillates and thus increases in height.

$


PHYEFFECT

$
Newtonian laws of motion.

No two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time.

$


INPUT

$
Torque applied on to it.

Movement of the crank.

$


ORGAN

$
Presence of the zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the crank.

Presence of one degree of freedom between the crank and connecting rod.

$

PARTS
$
The crank forms a revolute pair with the frame.

The connecting rod forms a revolute pair with the frame.
