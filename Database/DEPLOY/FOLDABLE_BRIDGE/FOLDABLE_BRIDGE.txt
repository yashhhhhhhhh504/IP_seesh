FUNCTION

$
This can be used to transport materials and tankers from one place to another if there is a gap in between the places.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists a number of foldable wooden planks that are connected by hinged joints.  
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
These hinged joints are activated at time of unfolding so that they can be deployed. After use they can be folded by activating the set of hinged joints and carried to any other place.

SUMMARY
$
This is mainly used in situations where heavy materials have to be moved from one place to another, places being separated by a river or trenches.
$

ACTION

$ 
To aid transportation.

To deploy the bridge.
$

STATE

$
The bridge is occupying less space when in folded state.

The bridge occupies large space when in use.



$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
To unfold.
