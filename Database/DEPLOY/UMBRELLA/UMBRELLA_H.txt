SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to increase area. It can be interpreted as a change of state from small area to large area. This can be described as follows to 

The slider (part) slides over the rod (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the slider and the rod (organ).

 The links (part) connected to the slider rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the slider (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time’ (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the links and the slider (organ).

The output links (part) moves rotates away from the rod (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the links connected to the slider (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the links (organ).
