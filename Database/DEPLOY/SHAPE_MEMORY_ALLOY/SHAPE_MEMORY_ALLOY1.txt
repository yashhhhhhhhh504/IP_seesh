FUNCTION


$
This alloy remembers its original shape even after is heated and its shape being changed.
$



STRUCTURE

$
It is material, which becomes flexible once heated. It has a unique property of remembering its original shape.

$

BEHAVIOUR

$
The material is heated using a flame and then it is twisted to a shape different from its original shape. Then it is cooled so that it gains its original shape.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used in situations where the material after some deformation has to regain its original shape and size.

The folded material (part) is heated (physical phenomenon). This is due heat energy (input), which activates the heat transfer effect (physical effect) and it requires the presence of oxygen in the surrounding to assist the burning of the fuel (organ).

The folded material (part) unfolds (physical phenomenon). This is due to the heating (input) of the material, which activates the transformation effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the required temperature for the transformation has been reached (organ).


$

ACTION

$ 
 To deploy.

 To regain its original shape.
