FUNCTION

$
This can be used to carry materials.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It actually consists of a number of wires, which meshed to form a basket.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The basket can be made to occupy less space when not in use by folding it.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to carry materials. Since they are made up of wire, which has high tensile strength, it can be made to carry heavy materials.
$

ACTION

$ 
 To carry materials.

To deploy.
$

STATE

$
Occupy less space.

Occupy large space.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
The basket is unfolded.


 



$


PHYEFFECT

$

INPUT

$
Moment.




$


ORGAN

$
Presence of one degree of freedom between the various links in the basket.
