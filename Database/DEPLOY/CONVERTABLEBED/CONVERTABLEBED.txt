FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used as bed as well as a sofa. It occupies less space when it is used as a sofa and more space when it is used as a bed.

$


STRUCTURE

$
it consists of two parts one is horizontal which is meant for sitting and the vertical part is for kneeling on.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The sofa is actually unfolded for it to be used as a bed. Thus it can be considered as a case of deployment.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used as bed and as a sofa. This can be described as follows:

The vertical part (part) of sofa is made horizontal (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input) activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a hinged joint between the horizontal and the vertical part (organ).
