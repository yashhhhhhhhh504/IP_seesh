FUNCTION

$
The simplest nail guns use ordinary springs to generate the hammering force
At its most basic level, a nail gun has only two jobs: 
* It needs to concentrate a great deal of hammering force into a single mechanized blow, which can be repeated rapidly. 
* It needs to load a new nail after the previous nail is ejected. 

$


STRUCTURE

$
The gun in this diagram uses the most popular sort of nail-loading mechanism. The nails are glued together loosely, in a long strip. This nail strip loads into the gun's magazine, which feeds into the "barrel" of the gun
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
In this design, the motor (powered by a battery or house hold ac current) rotates two drive axles. The front axle moves a small scooper plate; a metal disc with a curved groove cut into it, and the rear axle moves a gear train, which turns a small triangular metal cam.

SUMMARY
$
This can used to punch nails into the walls. This can be interpreted as a change of state from nail outside the wall to nail inside the wall. This can be discussed as follows:

The trigger (part) is pressed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied is enough to cause the motion (organ).

The front axle (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by (input) the motor, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it require the presence of zero degree of freedom between the front axle and the input shaft (organ).

The rear axle (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the motor (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the axle and the 
Input shaft (organ).

The scooper plate (part) rotates about the horizontal plane (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the axle (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the scooper plate and the front axle (organ).

The triangular cam (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the gears (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the triangular cam and the shaft (organ).

The lever (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the cam (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time”, (physical effect) and is necessary that lever is attached to a spring (organ).

The hammer (part) reciprocates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the oscillation of the lever (input), which activates the law no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time”, (physical effect) and is necessary that hammer is attached to a spring (organ).
