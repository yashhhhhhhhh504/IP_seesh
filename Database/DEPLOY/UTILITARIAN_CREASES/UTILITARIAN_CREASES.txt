FUNCTION

$
These boxes are used to carry materials since they provide protection to the materials carried.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The sheet is made up of cardboard. The sheet has prescored lines.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The sheet is folded to make up a box by folding it along prescored lines.

SUMMARY
$
This box is an example of deployment structures. The box occupies less space when it is made a box and occupies large area when spread to make a sheet. This can be discussed as follows:

The sheet (part) is folded to form a box (physical phenomenon). This is due to a sequence of moments applied (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the sheet has enough stiffness (organ).
