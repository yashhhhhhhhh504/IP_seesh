FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used as a deployment structure.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This consists of a number of flat plates, which are connected, with the help of elastic material.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The plates are deployed thus increasing the area occupied by it.

SUMMARY
$
The plates are unfolded and thus increased in the area that is occupied by the plates.
$

ACTION

$ 
 to deploy.
$

STATE

$
Occupying less area.

Occupying large area.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
The plates are unfolded.


$


PHYEFFECT

$
Newtonian laws of motion.



$


INPUT

$
Moment.

$


ORGAN

$
Presence of an elastic material between the two plates.



$



PARTS
$
Two parts of the deployable structure.
