FUNCTION

$
This device is basically used drawing purposes by drafters. Using this accuracy in drawings can be maintained.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of two scales, which are at right angles to each other.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The clamp is fixed on to the drawing board. The vertical and the horizontal scales are checked for alignment with the drawing sheet before it is put to use.

SUMMARY
$
This is mainly used by drafters to draw.
$

ACTION

$ 
To aid the process of drawing.

To occupy less space when not in use.
$

STATE

$
Occupy less area when not in use.

Occupy large area when in use.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
The scales are unfolded and thus increasing the area occupied.

$


PHYEFFECT

$
Newtonian laws of motion.
$


INPUT

$
Unwrapping force.

$


ORGAN

$
Presence of a hinged joint between the links.
