FUNCTION

$
To provide transportation from one place to another through air.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a fan, which rotates, in a horizontal plane.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
As the fan rotates the required lift is developed and the fan is operated using pedaling a cycle.

SUMMARY
$
It can be used to provide transportation from one place to another through air.
$

ACTION

$ 
 To provide transportation.
$

STATE

$
The flying machine is at rest.

The flying machine is flying.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
Pedal the cycle.

Rotate the fan.

Generate lift.


$


PHYEFFECT

$
Newtonian laws of motion.

No two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time.

$


INPUT

$
Torque.

Rotate the fan.

$


ORGAN

$
Presence of a crank that is connected to the shaft.

Presence of some kind of connection between the pedal and the fan.

Necessary that the speed of rotation of the fan is sufficient to generate the lift.
