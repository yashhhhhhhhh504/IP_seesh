FUNCTION

$
This device is used to store waste material. The lid of the dustbin covers the bin completely when closed. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a cylindrical bin whose one its end is open, which is covered by the lid. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The lid of the dustbin opens when the pedal is stepped down and it closes when the pedal is released.
