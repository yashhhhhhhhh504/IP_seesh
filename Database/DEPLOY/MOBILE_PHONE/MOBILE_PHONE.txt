FUNCTION

$
The screen of the mobile phone is rotated about the vertical axis to orient the cameral to required position.  
$


STRUCTURE

$
It basically consists of two parts one is the screen and the other is the keypad to in the numbers.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The screen part can be rotated about the keypad when it is unfolded. This is possible due to the presence of a hinged joint between the screen and the key pad which assists the unfolding of the mobile phone.
