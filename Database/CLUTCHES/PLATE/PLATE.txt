FUNCTION

$
Plate clutches transmit motion between two separate shafts through the friction of contact. Clutches are extensively used in the automobile industry, functioning as the device that helps in the changing of gears.
$


STRUCTURE

$
A plate clutch consists mainly of two plates whose surfaces are covered with materials that have high coefficients of friction. While the left sliding plate is fitted with a feather key, the right plate member is free to rotate on the shaft. The control arm, which is pivoted to the frame, fits into the slot of the left sliding plate. The right plate has a gear attached to it which mates with the output gear.
Excellent heat characteristics are a must, since mechanical energy is converted to heat in a clutch or brake. This means that a high heat capacity (which alleviates temperature rise), thermal conductivity (which encourages heat to mosey on through the friction material and into the surroundings), and properties which are invariant to high
temperatures.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
Since the left sliding plate is keyed to the input shaft, it rotates continuously. The right plate, however, is not keyed to the shaft, and therefore, rotation of the input shaft will not cause the right plate to rotate. Moreover, the gear on the right plate meshes with the output gear which further prevents the right plate from rotating due to friction. 
The left plate can be made to slide in its key, over the input shaft, with the help of the control arm. An upward motion of the control arm causes the sliding plate to move towards the right sliding plate.
When the output shaft is required to rotate, the cotrol arm is lifted so that both the plates are in contact with each other. Due to the high friction between the two, the right plate rotates, causing rotation of the output shaft.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to transmit motion between two shafts. This can also be used to change gears. This mechanism can be described as follows: 

The friction disk  (part) that is mounted on the input shaft establishes contact with the freely rotating friction disk (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force (input) applied by on the lever, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between lever and the input shaft-friction disk assembly (organ).

    The friction disk (part) that is mounted on the input shaft rotates (Physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque (input) applied by the input shaft, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between input shaft and the friction disk (organ).

                      The stationary friction disk (part), when contacted by the friction disk that is mounted on the input shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotational toque (input) applied by the friction disk that is mounted on the input shaft, which activates the friction effect (physical phenomenon) and requires the presence of friction material on the surface of the friction disks (organ).

       The gear (part) that is mounted on the stationary friction disk rotates (physical phenomenon) in the same direction as that of the friction disk. This is due to the rotation of the friction disk (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the gear and the friction disk (organ).

The gear that is mounted on the output shaft (part) rotates in a direction opposite to that of the gear mounted on the friction disk (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tangential force (input) exerted by the gear that is mounted the friction disk which activates the law “no two bodies scan occupy the same space at the same time “(physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between the two gears (organ).
