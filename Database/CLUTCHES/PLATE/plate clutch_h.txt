SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to transmit motion between two shafts. This can also be used to change gears. This mechanism can be described as follows: 

The friction disk  (part) that is mounted on the input shaft establishes contact with the freely rotating friction disk (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force (input) applied by on the lever, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between lever and the input shaft-friction disk assembly (organ).

    The friction disk (part) that is mounted on the input shaft rotates (Physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque (input) applied by the input shaft, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between input shaft and the friction disk (organ).

                      The stationary friction disk (part), when contacted by the friction disk that is mounted on the input shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotational toque (input) applied by the friction disk that is mounted on the input shaft, which activates the friction effect (physical phenomenon) and requires the presence of friction material on the surface of the friction disks (organ).

       The gear (part) that is mounted on the stationary friction disk rotates (physical phenomenon) in the same direction as that of the friction disk. This is due to the rotation of the friction disk (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the gear and the friction disk (organ).

The gear that is mounted on the output shaft (part) rotates in a direction opposite to that of the gear mounted on the friction disk (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tangential force (input) exerted by the gear that is mounted the friction disk which activates the law “no two bodies scan occupy the same space at the same time “(physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between the two gears (organ).
