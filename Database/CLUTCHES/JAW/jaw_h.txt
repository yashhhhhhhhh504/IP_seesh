SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to transmit motion between two shafts and can also be used to change gear.this can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation of the output jaw.

                  The teeth of the sliding part of the clutch that is mounted on the input shaft (part) engages with the teeth of the freely rotating part of clutch (physical phenomenon). This is due to the spring force (input) that activates the spring effect (physical phenomenon) and requires the spring to have some stiffness (organ).

                         The sliding part of the clutch, which is mounted on the Input shaft (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque (input) applied by the input shaft which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the sliding part (organ).

                   The freely rotating part (part) of the clutch having teeth on it rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation (input) of the sliding part of the clutch which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the space at the same time’ (physical effect) and requires engagement of the two parts of the clutch (organ).


                       The gear (part) that is mounted the freely rotating part of the clutch Rotates (physical phenomenon). This due to the rotation (input) of the Part of the clutch, which activates the “Newtonian laws of motion” (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between gear and the freely rotating part of the clutch (organ).


                                 The gear that is mounted on the output shaft (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This due to the tangential force (input) exerted by the  meshing gear, which activates the “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time (physical phenomenon) and requires the presence of contact between the two gears (organ).
