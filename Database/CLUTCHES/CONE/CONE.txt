FUNCTION

$
Cone clutches transmit motion between two separate shafts through the friction of contact. Clutches are extensively used in the automobile industry, functioning as the device that helps in the changing of gears.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Cone clutches are similar to plate clutches excepting that their friction surfaces that are slightly tapered and coaxial with the shaft. Friction material is usualy applied to only one of the mating conical surfaces. The free member is mounted to resist axial thrust.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
Cone clutches, like plate clutches, requires axial movement for engagement, but less axial force is required because of the increased friction between mating cones. Cone clutches have light engagement forces and high power transmitting capabilities, but are difficult to disengage. Cone units are not extensively used in modern power transmission systems.

SUMMARY
$

This mechanism can be used to transmit motion between two shafts . It can also be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation.

The smaller cone (part) engages with the bigger cone (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force of the spring (input), which activates elastic effect (physical effect) of the spring and requires the spring to have some stiffness (organ). 

The smaller cone (part), which is mounted on the input shaft, rotates (physical phenomenon). This due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input), which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the smaller cone (organ).

The bigger cone (part) when engaged with the smaller cone rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the smaller cone (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction surfaces between the two cones (organ).
 
The gear (part) that is mounted on the bigger cone rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the bigger cone (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the bigger cone and the gear (organ).

The gear that is mounted on the output shaft (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the meshing gear (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same place at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the meshing of teeth between the two gears (organ).
