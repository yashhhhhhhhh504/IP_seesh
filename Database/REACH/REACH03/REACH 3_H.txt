SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to reach different positions in a three dimensional space. This can be described as follows:

The link B (part) rotates in a horizontal plane with respect to the fixed link A (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft of the link B (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the link B (organ).

The link C (part) oscillates in a vertical plane with respect to the link B (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft of the link C (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the link C and the link A and the presence of one degree of freedom between the link C and the link B (organ).

The link D (part) oscillates with respect to the link C (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft of the link D (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion  (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the link D and the input shaft and it also requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the link C and the link D (organ).


The link E (part) oscillates with respect to the link D (physical phenomenon). This is due to rotation of the input shaft of the link E (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the link E and the link D and it also requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the link E and the input shaft (organ).


The link F that is the pendant (part) rotates completely with respect to the link E (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft of the link F (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft of the link F and the link F and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the link E and the link F (organ).
