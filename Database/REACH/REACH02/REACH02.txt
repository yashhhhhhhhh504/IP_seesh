FUNCTION

$
The pendant link of this mechanism reaches different positions in a three dimensional space. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The device consists of 7 links and is connected only by revolute pairs. 
Link A is a base or ground link and link G is a pendant link as shown in the figure.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
Link B rotates with respect to link A. Link B can have a complete rotation about link A. Link C rotates relative to link B. Link C doesn't have a complete rotation about link B. The link D oscillates about to link C. Link E rotates about link D and it can rotate for 360 degrees. Link F oscillates about E and the pendant link G rotates about link F. This is a six degree of freedom open chain mechanism. The directions of rotations of links B, C, D, E, F, G are shown in the figure. The link G can make it a 3 dimensional workspace.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to reach different positions in a three dimensional space. This is described as follows:


The link B (part) rotates completely with respect to the link A (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom in the direction of motion (organ).

The link C (part) rotates partially (not complete rotation) with respect to the link B (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates Newtonian laws of motion and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the link C and also the presence of one degree of freedom between link C and the link B (organ).

The link D (part) oscillates with respect to the link C (physical phenomenon). This is due to oscillation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft the link D (organ).


The link E (part) rotates completely with respect to the link D (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the link E and input shaft (organ).


The link F (part) oscillates with respect to the link E (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the link F and the input shaft (organ).

The link G (part) rotates completely with respect to the link F (physical effect).
This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the link G and input shaft (organ).
