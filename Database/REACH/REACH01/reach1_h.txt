SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used for reaching different positions in a three dimension. This mechanism can be described as follows:
 

The link 2 (part) rotates partially (not complete rotation) with respect to the fixed link 1 (Physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the link 2 and the input shaft and it also requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the link 2 and link 1 (organ). This motion of the link 2 is called pitch.

The link 3 (part) rotates partially (not complete rotation) with respect to the link 2 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the link 3 and it also requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the link3 and the link 2 (organ). This is motion is called yaw.


The link 4 (part) rotates completely with respect to the link 3 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) requires the presence zero degree of freedom between the link 4 and the input shaft and it also requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the link 4 and the link 3 (organ). This motion is called roll.
