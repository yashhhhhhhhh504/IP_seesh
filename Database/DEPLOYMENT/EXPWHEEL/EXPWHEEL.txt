FUNCTION

$
An expanding wheel has various applications in addition to acting as a pulley or another conventional wheel. Examples include electrical contact on wheel surfaces that allow many repetitive electrical functions to be performed while the wheel turns. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The expanding wheel consists of a base wheel and several adjustable sections. These adjustable sections will be connected to the wheel around the circumference. The number of sections required depends on the diameter of the wheel. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
Dynamic and static balancing is simplified when an expanding wheel is attached to a 
non-expanding main wheel. As a pulley, an expanding wheel can have a steel band fastened to only one section and then passed twice around the circumference to allow for adjustment.
The animation shown alongside illustrates the working of this mechanism.

SUMMARY
$
Using this mechanism, the diameter of the wheel can be increased or decreased. This can be described as follows:

The base wheel (part) rotates in a vertical plane (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the base wheel (organ).

The adjustable screw section (part) moves outward (physical phenomenon). This is due to the clockwise couple applied on to the screw  (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the base wheel is stationary (organ).

The adjustable screw section (part) moves inward (physical phenomenon). This is due to the anti clockwise couple applied on to the screw (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the base wheel is stationary (organ).
