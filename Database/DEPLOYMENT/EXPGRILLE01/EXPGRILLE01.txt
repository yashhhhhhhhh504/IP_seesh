FUNCTION

$
Expanding grilles are often put to work as a safety feature. The array of these grills can be used as lift doors. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
There are 7 links in this device. Links 4, 5, 6, 7 are binary links and are equal in length.  These 4 links make a loop. Links 1, 3 are similar, longer links and make up the main frame. Link 2 has two slots cut in it in order to constrain the motion of links 4, 5, 6, and 7. 
Links 1, 4, 5 and 3, 6, 7 are connected by multiple joints respectively. The pins that are used to connect links 4, 7 and 5, 6 slide in the slots on link 2. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The links 4, 5, 6, 7 acts as a parallelogram. If the distance between the points where 4, 5
and 6, 7 are connected, is taken as a length of diagonal of the parallelogram, then this length will be changed by changing the angle between links 4, 5 or 6, 7 and vice-versa. The links 1, 2, 3 move parallel to each other when the angle between 4, 5 or 6, 7 changes.
The animation shown alongside illustrates the working of this mechanism.

SUMMARY
$
These grilles can be used for safety features and can also be used for lifting doors. This can describe as follows:

There are 7 links in this system. The links 4,5,6 and 7 form a parallelogram.
The link 1 (part) moves apart (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force (input) applied on it, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the link 1 remains parallel to the link 2 as it moves (organ).

The links 4 and 5 (part), which are hinged on to a point on the link1, moves towards each other in the slots provided on the fixed link 2 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the link 1 (input) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the links 4, 5 and the link 1(organ).

The links, 6 and 7, which are respectively, connected to the links 5 and 4 (part) moves towards each other (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the links 4 and 5 (input) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the respective links

The link 3 (part) moves apart thus increasing the length of the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the links 4,5,6 and 7 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the links 6 and 7 (input) and requires that the link 3 remains parallel with the link 2 (organ).
$
