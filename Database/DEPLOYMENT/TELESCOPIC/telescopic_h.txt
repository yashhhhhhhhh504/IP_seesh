SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used for expansion and contraction. The above mechanism can be described as follows:


The link 2 (part) slides with respect to the link 1 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on to the link 2 (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the slides 1 and 2 (organ).

The link 3 (part) slides with respect to the link 2 (physical 
Phenomenon). This is due to the sliding of the link 2  (input), which activates the inertia effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the links 2 and 3.
