FUNCTION

$
Telescoping cylinders, as shown in the figure, are the basis for many expanding and contracting mechanisms.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Telescoping cylinders consists of three or more links. These links are connected to each other by cylindrical pairs. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
In the arrangement shown, nested tubes can be sealed and filled with a highly temperature responsive medium such as a volatile liquid. In doing so, one link slides over the other. In nested tubes rotation between links also allowed. The animation shown alongside illustrates the working of a telescopic cylinder.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used for expansion and contraction. The above mechanism can be described as follows:


The link 2 (part) slides with respect to the link 1 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on to the link 2 (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the slides 1 and 2 (organ).

The link 3 (part) slides with respect to the link 2 (physical 
Phenomenon). This is due to the sliding of the link 2  (input), which activates the inertia effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the links 2 and 3.


$

ACTION
$
 
 Using this mechanism expansion and contraction can be achieved.
