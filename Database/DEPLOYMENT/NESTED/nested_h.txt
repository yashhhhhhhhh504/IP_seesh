SUMMARY
$
The slide 2 (part) slides with respect to the slide 1 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on to the slide 2 (Input) which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of smooth sliding surface between the slides 1 and 2 (organ).

The slide 3 (part) slides with respect to the slide 2 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the slide 2 (input), which activates the inertia effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the slides 2 and slides 3 (organ).
