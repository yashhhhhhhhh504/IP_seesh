FUNCTION

$
Variable motion can be produced with this arrangement. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The device consists four equal links connected together by revolute pairs to make a loop. There are four other links that are guided to translate. Each of these links are connected at each joint of the four bar loop. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
In position (A), the 'Y' member moves faster than the 'X' member. In position (B), the speeds of both the members are equal at any instant. If the motion is continued in the same direction, the speed of X will increase.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to increase distance in horizontal or vertical direction. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The member x (part) moves towards the center of the center of the loop formed by the rotating links of the mechanism (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on to it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the member x move along a straight line (organ), which is accomplished by the use of guide ways.

The length of the diagonal increases in a direction perpendicular to the direction of motion of the member x and thus the translating members (part) that are connected to the ends of the diagonal moves away from the center of the loop (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the translating member x (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires that the length of the links forming the sides of the loop are equal (organ).

The member directly opposite to the member x (part) moves towards the center of the loop (physical phenomenon). This is due to the increase in the length of the diagonal (input), which activates the newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the member opposite to the member x moves along a straight line (organ).
