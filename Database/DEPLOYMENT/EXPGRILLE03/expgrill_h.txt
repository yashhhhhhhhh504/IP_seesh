SUMMARY
$
This can be used to increase distance in horizontal or vertical direction. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The member x (part) moves towards the center of the center of the loop formed by the rotating links of the mechanism (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on to it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the member x move along a straight line (organ), which is accomplished by the use of guide ways.

The length of the diagonal increases in a direction perpendicular to the direction of motion of the member x and thus the translating members (part) that are connected to the ends of the diagonal moves away from the center of the loop (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the translating member x (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires that the length of the links forming the sides of the loop are equal (organ).

The member directly opposite to the member x (part) moves towards the center of the loop (physical phenomenon). This is due to the increase in the length of the diagonal (input) and requires that the member opposite to the member x moves along a straight line (organ).

PHYPHENOMENON
{
$
The member moves along a straight line towards the center of the loop.
$
The length of the diagonal increases and the translating members that are connected to the ends of the diagonal moves away from the center of the loop.
$ 
The member directly opposite to the member x moves towards the center of the loop.

INPUT
{
$
The force applied on to the member x.
$

ORGAN
{
$
The straight-line motion of the member x.
$
The length of the links forming the sides of the loop being equal.
$
The member x opposite to the member x should move along a straight.

STUCTURE1
{
$
the translating members form sliding pairs with the guide ways.
$
The links forming the sides of the loop form revolute pairs with each other and the translating pairs.
