SUMMARY
$
This is usually used in lift doors. This can be described as follows:

The link 1 (part) moves away from its initial position (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on to the link 1 (input) which activates the Newtonian laws motion (physical effect) and requires that the force applied perpendicular to the link 1 (organ).

The diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the links 4,5,6 and 7 (part) increases (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the link 1 (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the link 1 move parallel to its original position (organ).
 
The link 2 moves away from its initial position (physical phenomenon). This is due to the increase in the length of diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the links 4,5,6 and 7 (input).
The diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the links 6,7,8 and 9 (part) increases (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the link 2 (input) and requires that the link 2 move parallel to its original position (organ).

The link 3 (part) moves away from its initial position (physical phenomenon), this is due to the increase in the length of diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the links 6,7,8 and 9 (input) and it requires that the link 3 moves parallel to its original position (organ).
