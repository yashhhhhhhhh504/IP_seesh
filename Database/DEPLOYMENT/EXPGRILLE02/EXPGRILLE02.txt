FUNCTION

$
Expanding grilles are often put to work as a safety feature. The array of these grills can be used as lift doors. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The kinematic structure of the device consists of 9 links. Links 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are binary links, of which links 4, 5, 8, 9 and 6, 7 are equal in length respectively. These 6 links make up two parallelograms. Links 1, 2, 3 are similar links. The links 1, 4, 5 and 2, 6, 7 as well as 8, 9, 3 are connected by a multiple joints.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
A double parallelogram requires none-but the middle grille-bar (link 2) must be held parallel by some other method. The links 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 forms a double parallelogram. If the distance between the points where 4, 5 and 6, 7 are connected, is taken as a length of diagonal of the parallelogram, this length will be altered by changing the angle between links 4, 5 or 6, 7 and vice-versa. The links 1, 2, 3 will move parallel to each other when the angle between 4, 5 or 8, 9 changes.
The animation showed alongside illustrates the working of this mechanism.

SUMMARY
$
This is usually used in lift doors. This can be described as follows:

The link 1 (part) moves away from its initial position (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on to the link 1 (input) which activates the Newtonian laws motion (physical effect) and requires that the force applied perpendicular to the link 1 (organ).

The diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the links 4,5,6 and 7 (part) increases (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the link 1 (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the link 1 move parallel to its original position (organ).
 
The link 2 moves away from its initial position (physical phenomenon). This is due to the increase in the length of diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the links 4,5,6 and 7 (input).
The diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the links 6,7,8 and 9 (part) increases (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the link 2 (input) and requires that the link 2 move parallel to its original position (organ).

The link 3 (part) moves away from its initial position (physical phenomenon), this is due to the increase in the length of diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the links 6,7,8 and 9 (input) and it requires that the link 3 moves parallel to its original position (organ).
