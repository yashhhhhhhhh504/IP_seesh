SUMMARY
$
This mechanism finds application in gates and shutters. This can be interpreted as change of from small horizontal distance to large horizontal distance and vice versa. This can be described as follows:

The link 1 (part) moves towards the other links and it also remains parallel to it (physical phenomenon). This due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of guide ways for the movement of link (organ).

The pin of the link 9 (part) slides in the slot provided in the link 2 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the link 1 (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the pin on the link 9 and the slot in the link 2 (organ).


The pin of the link 10 (part) slides in the slot of the link 4 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the link 9 (input), which activates the lever effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of a hinged joint between the links 9 and 10 (organ).

The link 1 (part) moves away from the other links (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of guide ways (organ).

The pin of the link 9 (part) slides in the slot provided on the link 2 (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the link 1 (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the pin of the link 9 and the slot of the link 2 (organ).
