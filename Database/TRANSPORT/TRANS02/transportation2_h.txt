SUMMARY
$
Using this mechanism materials can be transported. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The driven arms (part) mounted on the input shafts rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shafts and the driven arms (organ).


The connecting link (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the driven arm (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the driven arm and the connecting link (organ).

The swivel-arm (part) swivels (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the connecting link (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the connecting link and the swivel arm (organ).

The moving member (part) follows a somewhat an egg shaped path (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the connecting link  (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the connecting link and the moving member (organ).

The material (part) placed on the fixed rails (physical phenomenon). This is due to the forward motion of the moving member (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time,” (physical effect) and requires the presence of projections on the moving member (organ).
