FUNCTION

$
Roller coaster is a kind of bogie for amusement. It uses acceleration as key for amusement.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Roller coaster can move on steel track with ups and downs, curves. Due to this there is centripetal acceleration, gravitational acceleration. It can roll on the steel pipes and a motor at start drives it.
$

BEHAVIOUR

$
Roller coaster is started by linear induction motor. This is due to energy given by the motor to coaster, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires inertia of the roller coaster to be overcome. People in the bogie experience acceleration and get amused. This is due to up and down and curves which give change in velocity magnitude or direction or both and actuates Newtonian laws of motion, which requires getting centripetal or gravitational acceleration.

SUMMARY
$

Roller coaster is a kind of bogie for amusement. It uses acceleration as key for amusement. It can move on steel track with ups and downs, curves. Due to this there is centripetal acceleration, gravitational acceleration. It is explained below,

Roller coaster (part) is started by linear induction motor (physical phenomenon). This is due to energy given (input) by the motor to coaster, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires inertia of the roller coaster to be overcome (organ).

People in the bogie (part) experience acceleration and get amused (physical phenomenon). This is due to up and down and curves which give change in velocity magnitude or direction or both (input) and actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect), which requires getting centripetal or gravitational acceleration (organ).
