<DIV class=mediaTitle>Hovercraft</DIV>
<DIV class=mediaCaption>This British hovercraft is held above the surface of the 
water by blown air. Once the craft is above the surface, it moves much more 
efficiently than a boat plowing through the water. The propellers on the rear 
steer the hovercraft.</DIV>

<P id=p1><SPAN class=inline_title>Air-Cushion Vehicle</SPAN>, also hovercraft, 
craft that operates above the surface of water or land. The vehicle is supported 
on a cushion of air 1.2 to 2.4 m (4 to 8 ft) thick. The air cushion is provided 
by a large fan that pushes air downward within a flexible skirt attached to the 
perimeter of the vehicle. The skirt maintains the cushion by restraining the 
air. It makes the vehicle appear to be operating only a few inches above the 
surface. The vehicle is moved forward by propellers mounted above the vehicle or 
by control of the air exhaust through small openings around the skirt. Braking 
is controlled by reversing the pitch of the propeller or by changing the 
direction of airflow through the skirt vents. This phenomenon is also known in 
aerodynamics as ground effect.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p2>The operating controls are essentially like those found in an airplane. 
A control wheel adjusts the pitch of the vehicle, and rudder pedals control 
<I>yaw</I> (side-to-side movement). The speed over water is limited by wave 
height and wind speed. Operation of the vehicle is much the same when moving 
from water to land or vice versa; the air cushion prevents the hull from 
striking the ground when the terrain changes.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p3>Some air-cushion vehicles, such as the Bertin Hovertruck, have 
conventional wheel systems for travel over highways and solid ground, but for 
movement over marshland a built-in air-cushion system supports three-fourths of 
the weight of the truck. Most air-cushion vehicles, however, are designed for 
amphibious operation over water, marshy ground, and beaches.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p4>An experimental air-cushion vehicle, designed to run on a track similar 
to a monorail, reached a speed of 346 km/h (215 mph) on the 6.7-km (4.2-mi) 
concrete test track in Gometz-la-Ville, France. This so-called aerotrain rode on 
a cushion of air 0.25 cm (0.1 in) thick.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p5>The vehicles have both commercial and military applications, and a 
number of 15- to 30-passenger craft have been placed in operation around the 
world. One of the largest air-cushion vehicles currently in use is the 
150-metric-ton British SRN 4 hovercraft <I>Mountbatten,</I> which began service 
in July 1968. Designed for ferry and passenger service across the English 
Channel, the craft can carry 30 automobiles and 250 passengers.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>

than through, the water. They use large lift fans to push down air, which is 
trapped inside a heavy rubber skirt. The skirt gives the craft the hover height 
necessary to clear waves and other obstacles. Without water resistance, these 
ships can travel at up to 65 knots over the water. If their skirts or lift fans 
fail, the hovercraft settles onto the surface of the water and floats for the 
rest of the trip to port.</P><BR><HR><BR><H1>Bibliography</H1><BR><P> Microsoft® Encarta® Encyclopedia 2002. © 1993-2001 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</P></BODY></HTML>
