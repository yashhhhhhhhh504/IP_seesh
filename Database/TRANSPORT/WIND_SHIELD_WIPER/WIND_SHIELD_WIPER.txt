FUNCTION

$
The wipers faithfully keep the window clear, moving back and forth across the windshield countless times as they sweep the water away. On their highest speed, they move impressively fast, sometimes shaking the car from side to side.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The wipers combine two mechanical technologies to perform their task: A combination electric motor and worm gear reduction provides power to the wipers. A neat linkage converts the rotational output of the motor into the back-and-forth motion of the wipers. 

$
BEHAVIOUR

$
It takes a lot of force to accelerate the wiper blades back and forth across the windshield so quickly. In order to generate this type of force, a worm gear is used on the output of a small electric motor. The worm gear reduction can multiply the torque of the motor by about 50 times, while slowing the output speed of the electric motor by 50 times as well. The output of the gear reduction operates a linkage that moves the wipers back and forth. Inside the motor/gear assembly is an electronic circuit that senses when the wipers are in their down position. The circuit maintains power to the wipers until they are parked at the bottom of the windshield, and then cuts the power to the motor. This circuit also parks the wipers between wipes when they are on their intermittent setting. A short cam is attached to the output shaft of the gear reduction. This cam spins around as the wiper motor turns. The cam is connected to a long rod; as the cam spins, it moves the rod back and forth. The long rod is connected to a short rod that actuates the wiper blade on the driver's side. Another long rod transmits the force from the driver-side to the passenger-side wiper blade.

SUMMARY
$
This device is used to wipe out the water on the windshield. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rotation of the wipers. This can be discussed as follows:

The worm (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to torque applied by the motor (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the motor and the worm (organ).

The worm wheel (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the worm (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time”, (physical effect) and it requires the presence of contact between the worm wheel and the worm (organ).

The connecting arm (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the worm wheel (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the connecting arm and crank on the shaft carrying the worm wheel (organ).

The long arm (part) carrying the wipers oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to motion of the connecting arm (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the long arm and the wiper (organ).

The wiper (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the motion of the long arm (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the wiper and the long arm (organ).
