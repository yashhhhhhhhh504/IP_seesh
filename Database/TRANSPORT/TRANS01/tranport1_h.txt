SUMMARY
$
Using this mechanism material can be transported sequentially. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The cranks (part) rotate continuously (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shafts (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shafts and the cranks (organ).

The moving member (part), which is, actually sub divided into several parts oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the crank and the moving member (organ).


The objects (part) that are placed on the fixed rails move ahead (physical phenomenon). This is due to the oscillation of the moving member (input) which the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of projections on the moving member (organ).
