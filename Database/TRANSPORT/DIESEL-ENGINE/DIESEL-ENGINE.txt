FUNCTION

$
A diesel engine takes in air, compresses it, and then injects fuel into the compressed air. The heat of the compressed air lights the fuel spontaneously. A diesel engine doesn't need a spark plug.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The engine consists of a fuel injector, an inlet valve and an exhaust valve.
The compression ratio in the engine varies from 14:1 to 25:1.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
Diesel engines use direct fuel injection, which means the diesel fuel is injected directly to the cylinder. Gasoline engines generally use either carburetion, where the air and fuel is mixed long before they enter the cylinder.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used in automobiles to drive the transmission. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The air (part) enters the engine cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure differential (input), which activates the Bernoulli’s law (physical effect) and is necessary that the pressure outside the cylinder is higher (organ).

The piston (part) moves towards the inner dead center and thus compresses the air within the cylinder to a very high pressure (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion  (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth surface between the cylinder and the piston (organ).

The fuel injector (part) injects the fuel (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the plunger in the fuel injector (input), which activates the Bernoulli’s law (physical effect) and is necessary that the pressure inside the injector is higher than the pressure in the cylinder (organ).


The fuel-air mixture (part) undergoes combustion and thus produces large amount of hot gases (physical phenomenon). This is due to the increase in the temperature of the fuel (input), which activates the ignition effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the temperature thus produced is at least equal to the ignition temperature of the fuel (organ).

The hot gases (part) thus produced push the piston towards the crank side (physical phenomenon). This is due to the high of the pressure of the hot gases (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the gap between the piston and the cylinder is as small as possible (organ).

The piston (part) reciprocates in the engine cylinder and hence imparts rotary motion to the crank shaft (physical phenomenon). This is due to the conversion of the reciprocating motion of the piston to rotary motion (input) activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the crank and the piston rod (organ).
