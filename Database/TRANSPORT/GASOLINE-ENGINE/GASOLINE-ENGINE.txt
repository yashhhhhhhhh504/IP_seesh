FUNCTION

$
A car engine has one goal in mind: to convert gasoline and air into motion. The engine does this by burning the gasoline in thousands of tiny explosions, a process called internal combustion.

$


STRUCTURE

$
The engine consists of a piston cylinder arrangement. There is a spark plug to ignite the fuel air mixture. The piston rings are provided around the piston to prevent leaking of the fuel air mixture into the crankcase.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The entire process is accomplished in four stages and these four stages are as follows: intake stroke, the compression stroke, the combustion stroke and the exhaust stroke.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to drive transmission. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The air fuel mixture (part) enters the engine cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure differential (input), which activates the Bernoulli’s law (physical effect) and is necessary that the pressure inside the cylinder is lesser than the pressure outside the cylinder (organ).

The piston (part) moves towards the inner dead center (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of smooth surface between the piston and the cylinder walls (organ).

The air-fuel mixture (part) is compressed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the piston (input), which activates the “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the air fuel mixture is a compressible fluid (organ).


The spark plug (part) ignites the air fuel mixture (physical phenomenon). This is due to the electric arc that is struck (input) which activates the ignition effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the temperature reached is at least equal to the ignition temperature of the fuel (organ).

The air-fuel mixture (part) burns and thus release large amount of gases (physical phenomenon). This is due to the chemical energy of the fuel (input), which activates the chemical effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the air-fuel mixture is burnt completely (organ).

The hot gases (part) thus produced pushes the piston towards the outer dead center (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure exerted by the hot gases (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the gap between the piston and the cylinder is as small as possible (organ).

The crankshaft (part) rotates and thus drives the transmission (physical phenomenon). This is due to the reciprocating motion of the piston (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of a crank to convert reciprocating motion into rotary motion (organ).
