FUNCTION

$
A tire is a rubber casing that holds air. The air helps tires handle uneven road surface so that the car’s suspension does not have to handle every ripple and stone on the road.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The rubber casing includes the tread and the sidewalls. 
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The tread determines the amount of traction the tire have on wet and dry roads. The side walls handle the cornering forces. Designing a tire that does everything well, lasts a long time and does not cost much is an interesting challenge.

SUMMARY
$
This provides support for the vehicle and traction in regions like wet surfaces. This can be discussed as follows:

The flat portion (part) of the tires that comes in contact with the road supports the weight of the car (physical phenomenon). This is due to tire pressure (input), which activates the weight distribution effect (physical effect) and is necessary that there is sufficient pressure within the tire (organ).

The flat portion (part) of the tire bends (physical phenomenon). This is due to the overloading of the car (input), which activates the hooks law (physical effect) and is necessary that the tire is made up of a flexible material (organ).

The tires (part) provide traction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the presence of tread (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and it requires the presence of contact between the tire and the road surface (organ).
