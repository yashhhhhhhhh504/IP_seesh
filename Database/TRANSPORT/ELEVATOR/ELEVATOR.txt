FUNCTION

$
Elevators are used to lift or lower the passengers or goods from one level to other.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Elevators are used to lift or lower the passengers or goods from one level to other. It has a drum on which a steel rope is wound. On end of rope is connected to cabinet in which people stand, while other end is connected to counterweight. The rotation of drum moves the cabinet.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
Electric motor drives the input shaft of gearbox. This is due to electric energy taken by the motor, which actuates the laws, related to electric motors and requires correct voltage and current supply to motor. Gearbox rotates the output shaft at the set speed. This is due to engagement of gears with set velocity ratio, which actuates the law that no two bodies occupy the same space at the same time and requires the designed speed ration of the gears. 
Drum rotates. This is due to mechanical coupling connection power transmission from gearbox output shaft, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires perfect alignment between output shaft of gearbox and shaft of the drum. Steel rope wound on the drum lifts or lowers the cabinet. This is due to transmission of power through rope, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires that steel rope must have sufficient strength.

SUMMARY
$

Elevators are used to lift or lower the passengers or goods from one level to other. It has a drum on which a steel rope is wound. On end of rope is connected to cabinet in which passengers stand, while other end is connected to counterweight. Its working is explained below,

Electric motor (part) drives the input shaft of gear box (physical phenomenon). This is due to electric energy (input) taken by the motor which actuates the laws related to electric motors (physical effect) and requires correct voltage and current supply to motor (organ).

Gear box (part) rotates the output shaft at the set speed (physical phenomenon). This is due to engagement of gears with set velocity ratio, which actuates the law that no two bodies occupy the same space at the same time (physical effect) and requires the designed speed ration of the gears (organ)   

Drum (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to mechanical coupling connection power transmission (input) from gearbox output shaft, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires perfect alignment between output shaft of gearbox and shaft of the drum (organ).

Steel rope (part) wound on the drum lifts or lowers the cabinet (physical phenomenon). This is due to transmission of power (input) through rope, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that steel rope must have sufficient strength (organ)
