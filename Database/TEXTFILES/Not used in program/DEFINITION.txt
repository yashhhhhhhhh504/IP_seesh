link 
$ 
Link is a material body which will be connected to several other bodies to 
transmit power or force and to transform one form of motion to another form. 
A link which is connected to only one other link is known as a singular link. 
If it is connected to two other links, it is called a binary link. Similarly if a 
link is connected to three other links , it is referred to as a ternary link.

mechanism
$ 
Mechanism: Is a combination of rigid bodies or restraint bodies so shaped and 
connected that they move upon each other with definite relative motion 
$ 
dof 
$ 
Degree of freedom: The number of independent  coordinates required to 
completely specify the mechanism.

kc 
$ 
Kinematic chain: A kinematic chain is a series of links connected by kinematic pairs. 
The chain said to to be closed if every link is connected to at least two other 
links, otherwise it is termed an open chain.

crank
$
A link which makes a complete revolution and is pivoted to ground.
$
coupler
$
A connecting rod which has complex motion and is not pivoted to ground.
$
rocker
$
A link which has oscillatory (back & forth) rotation & is pivoted to ground.
$
ground link
$
Any link or links that are fixed (non-moving) with respect to the reference frame.
