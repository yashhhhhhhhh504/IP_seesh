FUNCTION

$
This is a Rack & Pinion mechanism that is used to grasp and release objects. The objects that this mechanism can hold depend on the shape of the jaws, which may be altered to suit the requirements. The shape of the jaws, shown in the figure, enables this mechanism to hold round or cylindrical objects. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
As shown in the figure, the device contains only 4 links. Link 2 is a base plate. Link 1 is an actuator, which reciprocates in the base plate and one end it contains a rack. Links 3 and 4, which are hinged to base plate, have one pinion on each and these are connected to a rack on link 1.  
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
Whenever link 1 gets actuated, links 3 and 4 rotate about the hinges because the rack will drive the pinions on these links on an actuator link. If the actuator moves away from the base plate, the jaws come closer and they can grip any object in between them. If the actuator moves towards the base plate the two jaws move away to each other and they release the object between them.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used for grasping and releasing objects. This mechanism can be described as follows:



The rack (part) being connected to the actuator moves away and towards the base plate alternately (physical phenomenon). This is due reciprocating motion of the actuator (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the rack and actuator (organ).

The links 3 and 4 (part) move outwards (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the rack away from the base plate (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the meshing of the pinions of the links with the rack (organ).


The links 3 and 4 (part) move inwards (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the rack towards the base plate (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the meshing of the pinions of the links with the rack (organ).
