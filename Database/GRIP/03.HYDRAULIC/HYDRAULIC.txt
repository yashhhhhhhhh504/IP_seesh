FUNCTION

$
This device is used to grasp and release objects. The objects that this mechanism can hold depend on the shape of the jaws, which may be altered to suit the requirements. This device consists of only one movable jaw. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
As shown in the figure, this device comprises of only 4 links. Link 1 is a base plate. Link 2 is a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder and link 3 is a piston, which moves in the  cylinder. Its one end is connected to the movable jaw (link 4). Link 4 is hinged to the base plate.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The device has one fixed jaw. The piston (link 3) is actuated by hydraulic or pneumatic pressure. The piston reciprocates in the cylinder and it rotates the movable jaw (link 4) about the hinge where it is connected to the base plate. The movable jaw moves closer to the fixed jaw to grasp objects and it acts vice-versa to release the objects.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to hold and release objects. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The movable jaw (part) rotates about the hinge thus moving away from the fixed jaw (physical phenomenon). This is due to the outward movement of the piston of the hydraulic actuator (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the cylinder of the hydraulic actuator to be fixed (organ). 

The movable jaw (part) rotates about the hinge thus moving towards the fixed jaw (physical phenomenon). This is due to the inward movement of the piston of the hydraulic actuator (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the cylinder of the hydraulic actuator to be fixed (organ).
