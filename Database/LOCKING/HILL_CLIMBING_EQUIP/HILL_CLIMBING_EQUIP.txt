FUNCTION

$
This used in trekking to get a grip while climbing. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The equipment actually is made up of a curved rod. One end of the rod has a provision for tying the rope.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
the curved rod is thrown upwards which clings on to a rock and then trekkers use the rope as a means to climb.
