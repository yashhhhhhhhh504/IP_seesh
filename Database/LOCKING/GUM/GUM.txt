FUNCTION

$
To join two different materials.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It made up of an adhesive material and it is necessary that the two different materials are made up of suitable material so the joining is possible.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
Gum is applied on to the two materials to be joined and the two materials are kept in contact and a weight is applied on it.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to join tow separate materials.
$

ACTION

$ 
 To join two materials.
$

STATE

$
Two parts are not joined.

Two parts are joined.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
Apply gum in the regions of the parts that have to be joined.

Apply pressure on the region in which the gum has been applied.
 

$


PHYEFFECT

$
Gravity effect.

Adhesive effect.


$


INPUT

$

Weight of the object that is placed on it.





$


ORGAN

$
Necessary that the pressure applied is high enough to cause the movement of the gum outside the tube.

Necessary that the weight of the object is sufficient enough to apply the required pressure.




$
