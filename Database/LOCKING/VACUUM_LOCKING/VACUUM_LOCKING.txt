FUNCTION

$
This kind of locking can be used to lock chambers.
$


STRUCTURE

$
this consists of a chamber that has to be closed with a door.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The vacuum locking functions with the help of the vacuum itself.

SUMMARY
$
The vacuum locking can be employed when there is pressure difference between the outside atmosphere and the chamber.
$

ACTION

$ 
 To operate the door of the chamber.
$

STATE

$
The door is closed.

The door is opened.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
The door rotates with respect to the hinged joint, which connects the door to the chamber.


$


PHYEFFECT

$
Bernoulli’s effect

$


INPUT

$
Pressure difference.


$


ORGAN

$
Necessary that the pressure difference is sufficient to cause the opening of the door.



$



PARTS
$
Door of the chamber.
