FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used to hold objects while some operations are being performed on the objects.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a 4 bar chain. In this mechanism the follower has an extension.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
In this mechanism the input is given to one of the links and the movement of the other links takes place due to the movement of the input link.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to hold objects. This can be interpreted as a change of state from release object to hold object. This can be described as follows:

The crank (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied on it (input), which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the crank (organ).

The follower (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of connecting rod (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the connecting rod and the follower (organ).

The clamping link (part) rotates with respect to the follower (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the follower (input), which activates the lever effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the clamping link and the follower (organ).
