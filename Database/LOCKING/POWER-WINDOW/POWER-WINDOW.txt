FUNCTION

$
The window lift on most cars uses a really neat linkage to lift the window glass while keeping it level. A small electric motor is attached to a worm gear and several other spur gears to create a large gear reduction, giving it enough torque to lift the window. An important feature of power windows is that they cannot be forced open -- the worm gear in the drive mechanism takes care of this. Many worm gears have a self-locking feature because of the angle of contact between the worm and the gear. The worm can spin the gear, but the gear cannot spin the worm -- friction between the teeth causes the gears to bind. 

$


STRUCTURE

$
The linkage has a long arm, which attaches to a bar that holds the bottom of the window. The end of the arm can slide in a groove in the bar as the window rises. On the other end of the bar is a large plate that has gear teeth cut into it, and the motor turns a gear that engages these teeth. The same linkage is often used on cars with manual windows, but instead of a motor turning the gear, the crank handle turns it. In the next section we'll learn about some of the neat features some power windows have, including the child lockout and automatic-up. 

$
BEHAVIOUR

$
When the driver presses one of the switches, one of the two side contacts is disconnected from the ground and connected to the center power contact, while the other one remains grounded. This provides power to the window motor. If the switch is pressed the other way, then power runs through the motor in the opposite direction.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to operate the window automatically. This can be interpreted as a change of state from open window to closed window. This can be described as follows:

The worm (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the worm (organ).

The worm wheel (part) rotates in the horizontal plane (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the worm (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of meshing between the wheel and the worm (organ).

The sector gear (part) rotates through a small angle (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the worm wheel (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between the gear and the wheel (organ).

The long arm (part) rotates with respect to the gear sector (physical phenomenon). This is due to the downward movement of the glass (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of hinged joint between the long arm and the sector gear (organ).

The glass (part) moves up and down (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the sector gear (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the sector gear and the glass (organ).
