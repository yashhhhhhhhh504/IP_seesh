FUNCTION

$
This mechanism is used to close bottles. This is done in order to avoid the interaction between the material in the bottle and the outside atmosphere. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
The mouth of the bottle has a number of threads on it and also the cap has the corresponding on its inner surface.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The cap is initially placed on the mouth of the bottle and rotated. As the cap rotates it also moves down and forms a tight joint between the cap and the bottle.

SUMMARY
$
This method of locking is usually used to store liquid.
$

ACTION

$ 
To lock. 
$

STATE

$
The bottle is open.

The bottle is closed.

$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
The cap is rotated keep it properly on the mouth of the bottle.
