The basic Piston Pump is very simple having just two valves and one stuffing box. 
In this example the reciprocating piston is driven back and forth by a rotating mechanism. 

This piston pump uses suction to raise water into the chamber. The lower valve can be placed below water level. 

The piston must be within about 25 feet of the water level, but the water can then be raised quite high.
