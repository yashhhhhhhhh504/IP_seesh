FUNCTION

$
This pump is more efficient that a single-acting force pump such as a simple Lift Pump or a hand-operated Bilge Pump.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a double acting piston that reciprocates within the cylinder and there are four valves, which are one-way valves.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
Each stroke of the piston fills one chamber and empties another, which nearly doubles the flow rate (less the volume of the piston rod) over a single-acting force pump. It also smoothens the flow. From the outside this pump can take many forms, but the basic principal of operation will be identical

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to displace liquid from a lower level to higher level. This can be interpreted as a change of state from liquid at a lower level to a higher level. This can be discussed as follows:

The double piston (part) reciprocates in the cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of a smooth surface between the piston and the cylinder (organ).

The valves (part) operate (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure difference (input), which activates the Bernoulli’s effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the valves are one-way valves (organ).

The liquid (part) within the cylinder is pressurized (physical phenomenon). This is due to the reciprocating motion (input) of the piston, which activates the “no two bodies can the same space at the same time”, (physical effect) and it is necessary that the piston have enough strength to displace the liquid (organ).
