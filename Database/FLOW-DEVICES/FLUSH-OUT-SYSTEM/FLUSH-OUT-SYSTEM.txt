FUNCTION

$
The purpose of a tank is to act like a bucket of water. You have to get enough water into the bowl fast enough 
to activate siphon. The tank holds several gallons of water. When you flush, all the water in the tank is dumped into the bowl in about 3 seconds.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Every toilet has three systems that work together. They are: the bowl system, the flush mechanism and the refill mechanism. 
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
A chain is attached to the handle on the side of the tank. When you push on the handle, it pulls the chain, which is connected to the valve. The chain lifts the flush valve, which then floats out of the way, revealing a drain hole that is approximately 3 inches in diameter.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to operate toilets. This can be described as follows: 

The flush handle (part) rotates about the hinge (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the frame and the flush handle (organ).

The flapper (part) opens and allows the water to flow out of the tank (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the chain (input) which in turn is due to the movement of the flush handle (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the chain and the flapper (organ).

The water (part) flows out of the tank and into the bowl (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure differential between the tank and the bowl (input), which activates the Bernoulli’s law (physical effect) and is necessary that the water level is higher than the level of the valve (organ).

The flapper (part) closes the valve (physical phenomenon). This is due to the reduction in the level of water (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the level of water in the tank is well below the drain (organ).

The water (part) flows into the tank (physical phenomenon). This is due to the opening of the valve (input), which activates the Bernoulli’s law (physical effect) and is necessary that the inlet valve is open (organ).
