FUNCTION

$
A modern vacuum cleaner develops its suction by means of a fan, which discharges a powerful stream of air from the rear end of the casing. This sets up a powerful inflowing current of air which carries along any dust particles from the carpet or floor to which the suction nozzle is applied.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Many vacuum cleaners have bag type of filters through which the air passes from the inside to the outside, the dust being collected in the bag. Here the dust is precipitated in the dust-collecting chamber in front of the filter.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
A sufficiently powerful airflow to carry along the dust and the grit particles is set up. Such airflow can only be induced by the suction developed by the fan. In a well designed vacuum cleaner the various nozzle attachments should be so dimensioned and shaped that the resulting performance is within the suitable working range.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to clean places and also air. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to flow of air. This can be described as follows:

The fan (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the fan (organ).

The air (part) along with the dust enters the vacuum cleaner (physical phenomenon). This is due to the suction force (input) created inside the vacuum cleaner which activates the vacuum effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the pressure outside the vacuum cleaner is higher when compared to the pressure inside (organ).

The filter (part) filters the air (physical phenomenon). This is due to the blocking force (input) applied on the dust particles, which activates the resistance to motion effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the size of the perforations in the filter is lesser than the size of the dust particles (organ).
