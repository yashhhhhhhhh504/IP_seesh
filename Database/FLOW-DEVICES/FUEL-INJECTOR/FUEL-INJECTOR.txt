FUNCTION

$
Fuel injector serves the purpose of injecting fuel inside the cylinder.
$


STRUCTURE

$
They have to generate pressure above the compression pressure in the cylinder. It has piston called as plunger inside a cylinder, a needle, spring which holds the needle on its seat and nozzle. They can get pressure of 80-300 atm.
$

BEHAVIOUR

$
Fuel comes inside the cylinder of the injector. This is due to low pressure created by the outward motion of plunger, which actuates Bernoulli's law and requires pressure inside the cylinder to be smaller than atmospheric pressure. Plunger compresses the fuel. This is due to upward motion of plunger, which actuates Bernoulli's law and requires smooth sliding and no leakage between plunger and cylinder. Needle is raised and fuel gets injected in the cylinder. This is due to fuel pressure acting on it, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires fuel pressure more than the spring pressure on the needle.

SUMMARY
$
Fuel injector serves the purpose of injecting fuel inside the cylinder. For this they have to generate pressure above the compression pressure in the cylinder. It has piston called as plunger inside a cylinder, a needle, spring which holds the needle on its seat and nozzle. Its working is explained below,

Fuel (part) comes inside the cylinder of the injector (physical phenomenon). This is due to low pressure (input) created by the outward motion of plunger, which actuates Bernoulli's law (physical effect) and requires pressure inside the cylinder to be smaller than atmospheric pressure (organ).

Plunger (part) compresses the fuel (physical phenomenon). This is due to upward motion (input) of plunger, which actuates Bernoulli's law (physical effect) and requires smooth sliding and no leakage between plunger and cylinder (organ).

Needle (part) is raised and fuel gets injected in the cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to fuel pressure (input) acting on it, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires fuel pressure more than the spring pressure on the needle (organ).
