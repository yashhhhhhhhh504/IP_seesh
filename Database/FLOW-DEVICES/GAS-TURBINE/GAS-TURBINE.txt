FUNCTION

$
Gas turbine engines are generally used for power generation.  It rotates its output shaft whose power can be harnessed for some other purpose.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Gas turbine engines are generally used for power generation. It rotates its output shaft whose power can be harnessed for some other purpose. It has compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine. It uses the chemical energy of the fuel in combustion.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
Compressor compresses the air. This is due to energy imparted by the compressor blades to air, which actuates Bernoulli's law and requires the proper design of the compressor and sufficient energy given by it. Compressed air is heated in combustion chamber. This is due to heat energy generated by the combustion of fuel, which actuates the laws of thermodynamics, and combustion and requires the maintaining of flame in the combustion chamber. Turbine shaft is rotated by the high velocity and high temperature air passing through it. This is due to force applied by the moving working fluid, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires the correct flow passage and turbine blade design.

SUMMARY
$
Gas turbine engines are generally used for power generation. It rotates its output shaft whose power can be harnessed for some other purpose. It has compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine. It is explained below,

Compressor (part) compresses the air (physical phenomenon). This is due to energy (input) imparted by the compressor blades to air, which actuates Bernoulli's law (physical effect) and requires the proper design of the compressor and sufficient energy given by it (organ).

Compressed air (part) is heated in combustion chamber (physical phenomenon). This is due to heat energy (input) generated by the combustion of fuel, which actuates the laws of thermodynamics, and combustion (physical effect) and requires the maintaining of flame in the combustion chamber (organ).

Turbine (part) shaft is rotated by the high velocity and high temperature air passing through it (physical phenomenon). This is due to force applied (input) by the moving working fluid, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the correct flow passage and turbine blade design (organ).
