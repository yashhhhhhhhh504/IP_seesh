Vacuum pumps are simply compressors that take in gas at a pressure lower than atmospheric pressure, compress it, and discharge the gas at atmospheric pressure. Since gas at low pressures has a large volume, vacuum pumps tend to be bulky. Steam jet ejectors are extensively used industrially for creating vacuum. Reciprocating piston and rotary-vane pumps are also widely used for producing vacuum.
