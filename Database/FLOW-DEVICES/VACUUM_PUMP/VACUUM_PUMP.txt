FUNCTION

$

Vacuum pumps are simply compressors that take in gas at a pressure lower than atmospheric pressure, compress it, and discharge the gas at atmospheric pressure. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
They consist of a piston and a cylinder arrangement. The cylinder has an inlet and outlet valves that are operated on the basis of pressure difference.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
Since gas at low pressures has a large volume, vacuum pumps tend to be bulky. Steam jet ejectors are extensively used industrially for creating vacuum. Reciprocating piston and rotary-vane pumps are also widely used for producing vacuum.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to displace liquid from a lower level to a higher level. This can be interpreted as a change of state from liquid at lower level to liquid at higher level. This can be described as follows:

The crank (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the crank (organ).

The piston (part) reciprocates within the cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the crank (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the piston and the connecting link (organ).

The liquid (part) enters the cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to the suction force, which is due to the inward motion of the piston (input), which activates the vacuum effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the pressure outside the cylinder is greater than the pressure inside it (organ).

The liquid (part) is pressurized and then displaced out of the cylinder through the outlet (physical phenomenon). This is due to the outward motion of the piston (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time”, (physical effect) and is necessary that the pressure inside the cylinder is greater than the pressure outside (organ).
