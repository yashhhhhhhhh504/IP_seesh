SUMMARY
$
The mechanism is called as Toggle-link reverser. The mechanism can be used to transmit power between two parallel shafts, which are separated small to medium distances. This can be described as follows:

The input gear (part) being mounted on the input shaft rotates in the counter clockwise direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the gear and the input shaft (organ).

The right follower gear (part) mounted the drive shaft rotates in the counter clockwise direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input gear (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of meshing of the gears (organ).

The drive shaft (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the right follower gear (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the right follower gear (organ), which is accomplished by the engagement of the ratchet clutch with the gear.


The bevel gear (part) mounted on the drive shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the drive shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the drive shaft and the gear (organ).

The output gear (part) being mounted on the output shaft rotates in the clockwise direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the bevel gear (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the meshing of two gears (organ).

The striking pin (part), which is mounted on the output gear, strikes against the reversing lever and displaces it (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the output gear (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time “ (Physical effect) and requires that the striking pin is longer than the gap between the out put gear and the reversing link (organ).

The toggle link (part) operates that is it moves to the left (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the reversing link (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space “ (physical effect) and requires that the toggle link be hinged to a certain point (organ).


The ratchet clutch (part) now engages with the left follower gear (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the toggle link and the spring (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires that the ratchet clutch form a sliding pair with the drive shaft and it also requires that the spring has some stiffness (organ).



The output gear (part) along with the out put shaft rotates in the opposite direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the drive shaft (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space” (physical effect) and requires that the ratchet clutch engage with the left follower gear (organ).
