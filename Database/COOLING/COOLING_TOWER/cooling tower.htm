<P id=p1><SPAN class=inline_title>Cooling Tower</SPAN>, device for reducing the 
temperature of a liquid, usually water, by bringing it into contact with an 
airstream where a small portion of the liquid is evaporated and the major 
portion is cooled. Cooling towers are used for large-scale air-conditioning 
installations, in the chemical industry, for cooling steam condensers of inland 
power plants if sufficient lake or river water is not available, and in a number 
of other industrial applications.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p2>Atmospheric air is normally not saturated with water and can absorb 
additional moisture until its relative humidity reaches 100 percent. This 
absorption process can be aided if the water is broken up into many small 
droplets, increasing the water surface area and thus the evaporation. The energy 
required for the evaporation into the airstream is provided by a fall in the 
temperature of the remaining water. For each pound of water evaporated, about 
980 Btu of energy become available for cooling the remaining water and for 
heating the airstream, an undesirable but necessary side effect (<I>see 
</I>British Thermal Unit). In practice, cooling towers work with water losses 
from 2 to 5 percent, depending on the conditions of operation.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p3>The hot water is initially piped to the top of the cooling unit and 
then broken up into droplets by being passed through a perforated plate. In 
large towers, a series of such plates are arranged on top of each other; the 
water drips down and comes in contact with upward flowing air. In small towers, 
the water simply drops over a series of slats. The tendency for the heated air 
to rise provides the airflow for very small cooling towers; but most larger 
units depend on having air blown over the plate arrangement, either by induced 
draft with a suction fan on the top or by forced draft with a blower on the 
bottom.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p4>The large cooling towers often identified with nuclear power plants are 
separate from such plants' reactors and do not discharge radioactivity. Cooling 
towers are also used by power plants fueled by coal or petroleum. These towers 
add greatly to the cost of power plants; however, the alternative of discharging 
large volumes of heated water into lakes and rivers has been proved detrimental 
to the environment.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>

<P id=p1><SPAN class=inline_title>Refrigeration</SPAN>, process of lowering the 
temperature and maintaining it in a given space for the purpose of chilling 
foods, preserving certain substances, or providing an atmosphere conducive to 
bodily comfort. Storing perishable foods, furs, pharmaceuticals, or other items 
under refrigeration is commonly known as cold storage. Such refrigeration checks 
both bacterial growth and adverse chemical reactions that occur in the normal 
atmosphere.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p2>The use of natural or manufactured ice for refrigeration was widespread 
until shortly before World War I, when mechanical or electric refrigerators 
became available. Ice owes its effectiveness as a cooling agent to the fact that 
it has a constant fusion temperature of 0° C (32° F). In order to melt, ice must 
absorb heat amounting to 333.1 kJ/kg (143.3 Btu/lb). Melting ice in the presence 
of a dissolving salt lowers its melting point by several degrees. Foodstuffs 
maintained at this temperature or slightly above have an increased storage life. 
Solid carbon dioxide, known as dry ice, is used also as a refrigerant. Having no 
liquid phase at normal atmospheric pressure, it sublimes directly from the solid 
to vapor phase at a temperature of -78.5° C (-109.3° F). Dry ice is effective 
for maintaining products at low temperatures during the period of 
sublimation.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p3>In mechanical refrigeration, constant cooling is achieved by the 
circulation of a refrigerant in a closed system, in which it evaporates to a gas 
and then condenses back again to a liquid in a continuous cycle. If no leakage 
occurs, the refrigerant lasts indefinitely throughout the entire life of the 
system. All that is required to maintain cooling is a constant supply of energy, 
or power, and a method of dissipating waste heat. The two main types of 
mechanical refrigeration systems used are the compression system, used in 
domestic units for large cold-storage applications and for most air 
conditioning; and the absorption system, now employed largely for heat-operated 
air-conditioning units but formerly also used for heat-operated domestic 
units.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>

SYSTEMS</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P id=p4>Compression systems employ four elements in the refrigeration cycle: 
compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator. In the evaporator the 
refrigerant is vaporized and heat is absorbed from the material contents or the 
space being cooled. The vapor next is drawn into a motor-driven compressor and 
elevated to high pressure, which raises its temperature. The resulting 
superheated, high-pressure gas is then condensed to liquid in an air- or 
water-cooled condenser. From the condenser the liquid flows through an expansion 
valve, in which its pressure and temperature are reduced to the conditions that 
are maintained in the evaporator.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>

<TD class=section_title vAlign=bottom>REFRIGERANTS</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P id=p5>For every refrigerant there is a specific boiling, or vaporization, 
temperature associated with each pressure, so that it is only necessary to 
control the pressure in the evaporator to obtain a desired temperature. A 
similar pressure-temperature relationship holds in the condenser. One of the 
most widely used refrigerants for many years has been dichlorodifluoromethane, 
known popularly as Refrigerant-12. This synthetic chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) when 
used as a refrigerant would, for example, vaporize at -6.7° C (20° F) in its 
evaporator under a pressure of 246.2 kPa (35.7 psi), and after compression to 
909.2 kPa (131.9 psi) would condense at 37.8° C (100° F) in the condenser. The 
resulting condensed liquid would then enter the expansion valve to drop to 
evaporator pressure and repeat the cycle of absorbing heat at low temperature 
and low pressure and dissipating heat at the much higher condenser pressure and 
temperature. In small domestic refrigerators used for food storage, the 
condenser heat is dissipated into the kitchen or other room housing the 
refrigerator. With air-conditioning units the condenser heat must be dissipated 
out of doors or directly into cooling water.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p6>In a domestic refrigeration system the evaporator, called the freezer, 
is always placed in an insulated space. In some cases this space constitutes the 
whole refrigerator cabinet. The compressor is usually oversized, so that if it 
ran continuously it would produce progressively lower temperatures. In order to 
maintain the interior of the box within the desired temperature range, the motor 
driving the compressor is controlled by a thermostatic switch.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p7>A frozen-food refrigerator resembles the household refrigerator except 
that its compressor and motor must be of sufficient size to handle the larger 
gas volume of the refrigerant at its lower evaporator pressure. For example, to 
maintain a temperature of -23.3° C (-10° F) an evaporator pressure of 132.3 kPa 
(19.2 psi) is required with Refrigerant-12.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>

<TD class=section_title vAlign=bottom>ABSORPTION 
SYSTEM</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P id=p8>A few household units, called gas refrigerators, operate on the 
absorption principle. In such gas refrigerators a strong solution of ammonia in 
water is heated by a gas flame in a container called a generator, and the 
ammonia is driven off as a vapor, which passes into a condenser. Changed to a 
liquid state in the condenser, the ammonia flows to the evaporator as in the 
compression system. Instead of the gas being inducted into a compressor on exit 
from the evaporator, however, the ammonia gas is reabsorbed in the partially 
cooled, weak solution returning from the generator, to form the strong ammonia 
solution. This process of reabsorption occurs in a container called the 
absorber, from which the enriched liquid flows back to the generator to complete 
the cycle.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
<P id=p9>Increasing use of absorption refrigeration now occurs in refrigeration 
units for comfort space cooling, for which purpose refrigerant temperatures of 
45° to 50° F (7.2° to 10° C) are suitable. In this temperature range, water can 
be used as a refrigerant with an aqueous salt solution, usually lithium bromide, 
as the absorbent material. The very cold boiling water from the evaporator is 
absorbed in concentrated salt solution. This solution is then pumped into the 
generator, where, at elevated temperature, the surplus water is boiled off to 
increase the salt concentration of the solution; this solution, after cooling, 
recirculates back to the absorber to complete the cycle. The system operates at 
high vacuum at an evaporator pressure of about 1.0 kPa (0.145 psi); the 
generator and condenser operate at about 10.0 kPa (1.45 psi). The units are 
usually direct-fired or use steam generated in a boiler.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>

<P id=p10>Refrigerant-12 and related CFCs, Refrigerant-11 and Refrigerant-22, 
are currently the major compounds used in the cooling and insulation systems of 
home refrigeration units. It has been found, however, that CFCs are posing a 
major threat to the global environment through their role in the destruction of 
the ozone layer. A search has therefore begun for replacements, and some 
manufacturers of CFCs have already pledged to phase out these products by the 
end of the century.<SPAN class=breakfloat></SPAN></P>
