      towers</FONT></BIG></B></FONT></P><FONT face=Arial size=2>
      <P>Just like air, water is one of our most important natural resources and 
      vital to all our lives.</P>
      <P>The world’s growing water consumption combined with its increasing 
      scarcity is making it more important than ever to use water intelligently 
      and carefully.</P>
      <P>The re-cooling and recycling of water as a transport medium for waste 
      heat for which there is no further intelligent use should therefore be the 
      first rules of economy and ecology.</FONT><FONT face=Arial><B></P>
      <P>Water cooling systems</B></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2></P>
      <P>Water cooling systems can be subdivided into various categories on the 
      basis of the cooling water temperatures they require. At temperatures of 
      below approx. +20 ºC refrigeration machines are generally used. Above this 
      temperature cooling towers are used. At temperature over 45 ºC dry-type 
      cooling units can also be employed.</FONT><FONT face=Arial><B></P>
      <P>Types of cooling towers</B></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2></P>
      <P>Cooling towers are distinguished according to various criteria:</P>
      <P>1. The forced of the air-stream:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Naturally ventilated cooling towers (natural draught cooling 
        towers)</P>
        <P>Artificially ventilated cooling towers (mechanical draught cooling 
        tower). Fans may be of the induced or forced draught type 
      design.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>2. The relationship of the air-stream to the water flow:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Counter-flow cooling towers</P>
        <P>Cross-flow cooling towers</P>
        <P>Combination of these two designs</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>3. The design of the fill material:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Open systems in which the water is cooled by direct contact with the 
        surrounding air (wet-type cooling towers)</P>
        <P>Closed systems in which the medium to be cooled does not come into 
        direct contact with the surrounding air</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hybrid cooling 
      towers, a combination of open and closed systems.</FONT></P><FONT 
      face=Arial size=2>
      <P>Wet-type cooling towers are able to achieve water temperatures below 
      the ambient temperature, the decisive factor being the so-called wet-bulb 
      temperature. This represents a physical value for the relationship between 
      ambient temperature and relative air humidity.</P>
      <P>Wet-type cooling towers can reach the minimum cold water temperatures 
      of approx. 3-4 K above the wet-bulb temperature. In Australia standard 
      wet-bulb temperatures are dependant on the location: Melbourne 20ºC, 
      Adelaide 23ºC, Sydney 24ºC, Perth 25ºC, Brisbane 25ºC, Hobart 19ºC 
      etc.<B></P>
      <P>Open wet-type cooling towers</B></P>
      <P>The water to be cooled is sprayed and trickled over fill material by a 
      water distribution system, which, owing to its shape and position, 
      guarantees high water and air contact times. At the same time, the 
      surrounding air is fed through the tower in counter-flow, thereby 
      evaporating a small part of the circulating water. The heat required for 
      this evaporation process is drawn off by the cooling water and provides 
      the majority of the cooling capacity. The remainder of the cooling 
      capacity is created by the convection of the warm water to the cold 
      air.</P>
      <P>The re-cooled water collects in the collecting basin from where it is 
      fed back to the cooling points. The saving in terms of cooling water in 
      comparison with continuous flow cooling can be up to 97% of the 
      circulation water, the remainder being required to compensate for the 
      water loss due to evaporation and bleed-off.<B></P>
      <P>Closed-type cooling towers and coolers</B></P>
      <P>The medium to be cooled flows through a closed heat exchanger and does 
      not come into direct contact with the surrounding air. Water is trickled 
      over the heat exchanger by a water distribution system (secondary circuit) 
      in order to use the evaporation heat. <B></P>
      <P>Dry-type coolers</B></P>
      <P>The medium to be cooled flows through a heat exchanger just as for 
      closed cooling towers. Heat is removed by means of convection to the 
      surrounding air thus allowing the system to attain cooling water 
      temperatures in excess of ambient temperature</FONT> </P>
