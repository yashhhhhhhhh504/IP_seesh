FUNCTION

$
Refrigerator is basically keeps the space, inside the cabinet, cool in order to keep food fresh for longer time. $


STRUCTURE

$
It uses the fact that in the process of evaporation, liquids absorb heat. It has compressor, condenser, expansion device, evaporator and working fluid that is called as refrigerant.
$

BEHAVIOUR

$
The compressor compresses refrigerant. This is due to energy provided by the reciprocating pistons in the compressor, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires the outlet pressure of the compressor smaller than that of the delivery pressure. Condenser cools the compressed refrigerant. This is due to heat released to the environment, which actuates the laws of conduction, convection and radiation and requires the temperature of surrounding lower than that of condenser. Expansion device reduces the pressure and cools the condensed refrigerant. This is due to frictional loss if the expansion device is capillary tube of longer length in the condenser, which actuates the Bernoulli's equation and requires correct design of expansion device. Evaporator absorbs heat from the space, which is to be cooled. This is due to the evaporation of the refrigerant, which actuates laws of heat transfer and requires the cabinet space to be hotter than the refrigerant.

SUMMARY
$
Refrigerator is basically keeps the space, inside the cabinet, cool in order to keep food fresh for longer time. It uses the fact that in the process of evaporation, liquids absorb heat. It has compressor, condenser, expansion device, evaporator	 and working fluid that is called as refrigerant. It is explained below,

Refrigerant (part) is compressed by the compressor (physical phenomenon). This is due to energy provided (input) by the reciprocating pistons in the compressor, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the outlet pressure of the compressor smaller than that of the delivery pressure (organ).

Condenser (part) cools the compressed refrigerant (physical phenomenon). This is due to heat released (input) to the environment, which actuates the laws of conduction, convection and radiation (physical effect) and requires the temperature of surrounding lower than that of condenser (organ).

Expansion device (part) reduces the pressure and cools the condensed refrigerant (physical phenomenon). This is due to frictional loss (input) if the expansion device is capillary tube of longer length in the condenser, which actuates the Bernoulli's equation (physical effect) and requires correct design of expansion device (organ).

Evaporator (part) absorbs heat from the space, which is to be cooled (physical phenomenon). This is due to the evaporation of the refrigerant (input) , which actuates laws of heat transfer (physical effect) and requires the cabinet space to be hotter than the refrigerant (organ).
