FUNCTION

$
the operation of boring is carried out to increase the diameter of a already drilled hole. This operation of boring is carried out on lathe machine.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The lathe consists of a bed on which the tailstock and headstock are mounted and the tool is held in the tail stock. 
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The work piece is held in the headstock and rotated. The tool is moved along the axis of the lathe. The speed of the headstock is variable and is varied based on the necessity.

SUMMARY
$
This operation can be performed to machine components. This can be described as follows:

The tool (part) is held tightly on to the tool post (physical phenomenon). This is due to the clamping force (input) applied by the clamp, which activates the resistance to motion effect (physical effect) and it requires the presence of friction surface between the tool and the clamp (organ).

The drilled component (part) is held in the spindle (physical phenomenon). This is due to the clamping force (input) of the jaws, which activates the resistance to motion effect (physical effect) and it requires the presence of friction surface between the drilled component and the jaws of the lathe (organ).

The drilled component (part) is rotated (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the spindle (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the drilled component and the spindle (organ).

The drilled component (part) is machined (physical phenomenon). This is due to the shearing action (input), which activates the machining effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the tool is harder than the drilled component (organ).
