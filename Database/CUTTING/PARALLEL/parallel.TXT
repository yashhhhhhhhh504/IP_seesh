FUNCTION

$
This mechanism is used to cut material using two knifes which are parallel to each other
$


STRUCTURE

$
One of the knives is attached to the slider, while the other one is attached to the link over which the slider traverses. The two knifes are attached such that the cutting edges are opposite to each other. The slider and the second link form revolute pairs with two cranks, which pivot in opposite directions.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
As the two pivoted cranks rotate in opposite directions, the slider, along with the knife, moves downwards. The second knife moves upwards in the same fashion. The cutting edges of the knives move parallel to each other, and they also remain vertical at all times to cut the material when it is in motion. The two cranks are rotated with constant velocity by a 1 to 1 gear system (not shown), which also feeds material through the mechanism.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used for cutting materials. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to sliding motion. This can be described as follows:


The input cranks (part) rotate (physical phenomenon). This is due to rotation of the input shafts (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the cranks (organ).

The knife edges (part) move parallel to each other and they cut the objects (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input cranks (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the knife edges are opposite to each other (organ).
