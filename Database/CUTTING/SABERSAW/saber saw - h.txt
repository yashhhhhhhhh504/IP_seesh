SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used for cutting materials. This mechanism can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The bevel gear (part) mounted on the input shaft rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the bevel gear (organ).


The pin (part) mounted on the bevel gear rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the bevel gear (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the bevel gear and pin (organ).

The blade (part) reciprocates in the vertical direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pin (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time,” (physical effect) and is necessary that the pin slides in between the two parallel plates (organ).
