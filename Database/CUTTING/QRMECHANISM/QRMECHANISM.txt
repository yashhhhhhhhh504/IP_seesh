FUNCTION

$
Quick return mechanism serves the function of traversing an object faster in one direction than the other.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It has three turning pairs and one sliding pair. Generally crank, which is the input link, is driven at constant speed by an electric motor. The rocker link oscillates about a turning joint. Rocker link has angular velocity of higher magnitude in one direction than the other. 
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
Crank rotates at constant angular velocity. This is due to torque applied on it by electric motor, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires torque to overcome the inertia forces. Rocker link oscillates such that it moves faster in one direction than the other. This is due to torque applied on it by crank, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires the geometry of mechanism such that angle covered by crank in one direction travel of rocker to be smaller then the other.

SUMMARY
$

Quick return mechanism serves the function of traversing an object faster in one direction than the other. It has three turning pairs and one sliding pair. Generally crank, which is the input link, is driven at constant speed by an electric motor. The rocker link oscillates about a turning joint. Its working is explained below,

Crank (part) rotates at constant angular velocity (physical phenomenon). This is due to torque (input) applied on it by electric motor, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires torque to overcome the inertia forces (organ).

Rocker link (part) oscillates such that it moves faster in one direction than the other (physical phenomenon). This is due to torque (input) applied on it by crank, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the geometry of mechanism such that angle covered by crank in one direction travel of rocker to be smaller then the other (organ).
