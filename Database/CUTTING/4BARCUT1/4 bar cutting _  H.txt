SUMMARY
$
This four-bar cutter provides a stable, strong, cutting action by coupling two sets of links to chain four-bar arrangements. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to straight –line motion. This can be described as follows:

The gear 5 and 2 (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque applied by the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the gears (organ).

The gears 4,6,1,3 (parts) rotate (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the gears 2 and 5 (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between them (organ).

The links 8 and 11 (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the gears (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the links and the gear (organ).

The knife edges (part) moves along a straight line (physical phenomenon). This is due to the oscillation of the links (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the links oscillate with the same speed (organ).
