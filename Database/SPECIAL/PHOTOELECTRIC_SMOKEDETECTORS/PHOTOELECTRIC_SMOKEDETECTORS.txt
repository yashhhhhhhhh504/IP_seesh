SUMMARY
$
This device is used to detect smoke. This can be discussed as follows:

The light emitter (part) emits light in a direction perpendicular the smoke detector (physical phenomenon). This is due to the positioning of the light source in a direction perpendicular to the smoke detector (input), which activates the light propagation effect (physical effect) and it requires the presence of appropriate medium for the propagation of light (organ).

When smoke fills the chamber, the light (part) is deflected towards the smoke detector (physical phenomenon). This is due to the bouncing of light (input) onto the smoke, which activates the deflection effect (physical effect) and is necessary that there is sufficient amount of smoke in the chamber (organ).

The smoke detector (part) rings a bell (physical phenomenon). This is due to the detecting of light by the light detector (input), which activates the photoconductivity effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the deflected light falls on the light detector in the smoke detector (organ).
