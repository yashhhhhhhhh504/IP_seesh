FUNCTION

$
Microwave ovens use radio waves for cooking food in kitchen.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Microwave ovens use radio waves for cooking food in kitchen. Instead of conducting hest, it excites the atoms of food. Excitation of food atoms in turn heats the food and cooks it. The air around the food does not get heated. Microwave heating is an efficient way of heating.
$

BEHAVIOUR

$
Water and fat content of the food receives radio waves. This is due to transmission of radio waves from radio wave emitting elements located in the oven, which actuates the laws, related to radiation heat transfer which require temperature of food to be lower than that of the emitting elements. Radio waves excite the atoms of the food. This is due to absorption of radio waves, which actuates the laws of heat transfer and thermodynamics and require sufficient amount of energy to be received by food in the form of radio waves.

SUMMARY
$
Microwave ovens use radio waves for cooking food in kitchen. Instead of conducting hest, it excites the atoms of food. Its working is explained below,

Water and fat content of the food (part) receives radio waves (physical phenomenon). This is due to transmission of radio waves (input) from radio wave emitting elements located in the oven which actuates the laws related to radiation heat transfer (physical effect) which require temperature of food to be lower than that of the emitting elements (organ).

Radio waves (part) excite the atoms of the food (physical phenomenon). This is due to absorption of radio waves (input), which actuates the laws of heat transfer and thermodynamics (physical effect) and require sufficient amount of energy to be received by food in the form of radio waves (organ).
