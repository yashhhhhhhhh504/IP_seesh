SUMMARY
$
The pendulum is employed in a clock in order to enable the second hand make exactly one revolution per minute. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The weight (part) moves downward (physical phenomenon). This is due to gravitational force exerted on it (input), which activates the gravity effect (physical effect) and requires that the weight be held at a suitable height from the ground level (organ).


The pulley (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tangential force exerted by the unwinding cord (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction surface between the pulley and the chord (organ).


The escape wheel (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pulley (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the pulley and the escape wheel in the direction of motion (organ).

The anchor (part) oscillates about its center (physical phenomenon). This is due to the oscillation of the pendulum (input), which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the anchor and the pendulum in the direction of motion (organ).
