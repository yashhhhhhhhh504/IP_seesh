FUNCTION

$
The pendulum is employed in a clock in order to enable the second hand make exactly one revolution per minute. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
There are five basic parts in a pendulum clock. The weight or spring provides the energy to turn the hands of the clock. The high ratio weight gear train gears the weight drum up so that the clock need not be rewound very often. The escapement is made up of the pendulum and the escapement gear which precisely regulates the speed at which the weight’s energy is released. The hand gear train gears down so that the minute and hour hand turn at the correct rates. The setting mechanism somehow disengages, slips or ratchets the gear train so that the clock can be wound and set. 
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The period of a pendulum's swing (the amount of time it takes for a pendulum to go back and forth once) is related only to the length of the pendulum and the force of gravity. Because gravity is constant at any given spot on the planet, the only thing that affects the period of a pendulum that you can control is the length of the pendulum. The amount of weight does not matter, nor does the length of the arc that the pendulum swings through, only the length of the pendulum matters. 
A pendulum clock needs a gear with teeth of some special shape and a device attached to the pendulum that can engage the teeth of the gear. The basic idea is that for each swing of the pendulum back and forth, one tooth of the gear is allowed to escape. Therefore, the device that is attached to the pendulum that engages the gear teeth is called an escapement. 
The idea behind the weight is to act as an energy storage device so that the clock can run, unattended, for relatively long periods of time. It is like a battery. When a weight-driven clock is "wound", a cord is pulled that lifts the weight. That gives the weight potential energy in the earth's gravitational field.

SUMMARY
$
The pendulum is employed in a clock in order to enable the second hand make exactly one revolution per minute. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The weight (part) moves downward (physical phenomenon). This is due to gravitational force exerted on it (input), which activates the gravity effect (physical effect) and requires that the weight be held at a suitable height from the ground level (organ).


The pulley (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tangential force exerted by the unwinding cord (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction surface between the pulley and the chord (organ).


The escape wheel (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pulley (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the pulley and the escape wheel in the direction of motion (organ).

The anchor (part) oscillates about its center (physical phenomenon). This is due to the oscillation of the pendulum (input), which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the anchor and the pendulum in the direction of motion (organ).
