FUNCTION

$
Tire pressure gauges are used to measure pressure inside the tire. It uses the compression of a spring as an indicator to measure pressure.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Tire pressure gauges are used to measure pressure inside the tire. It uses the compression of a spring as an indicator to measure pressure. It has a cylinder and piston, which is held, in its original position by a spring. At the one end of piston there is a spherical part to allow tire air to come in.
$

BEHAVIOUR

$

Air from tire comes in the pressure gauge. This is due to insertion of spherical part small rod in the valve of tire, which actuates Bernoulli's principle and requires perfect sealing between tire valve and the spherical part of the pressure gauge. Force is exerted on the piston in the tube. This is due to air pressure, which has entered the tube, which actuates the Pascal's law and requires that there has to be perfect sealing between piston and the tube. 
Piston moves against the spring. This is due to the force exerted on it, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires the smooth sliding action and one degree of freedom between piston and the tube. A rod on which the scale is attached comes, and which shows reading out. This is due to movement of piston, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion and requires the smooth sliding between rod and tube.

SUMMARY
$
Tire pressure gauges are used to measure pressure inside the tire. It uses the compression of a spring as an indicator to measure pressure. It has a cylinder and piston, which is held, in its original position by a spring. At the one end of piston there is a spherical part to allow tire air to come in. It is explained below,

Air (part) from tire comes in the pressure gauge (physical phenomenon). This is due to insertion (input) of spherical part small rod in the valve of tire, which actuates Bernoulli's principle (physical effect) and requires perfect sealing between tire valve and the spherical part of the pressure gauge (organ)

Force is exerted on the piston (part) in the tube (physical phenomenon). This is due to air pressure (input), which has entered the tube, which actuates the Pascal's law (physical effect) and requires that there has to be perfect sealing between piston and the tube (organ).

Piston (part) moves against the spring (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force (input) exerted on it, which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the smooth sliding action and one degree of freedom between piston and the tube (organ).

A rod (part) on which the scale is attached comes, and which shows reading out (physical phenomenon). This is due to movement of piston (input), which actuates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the smooth sliding between rod and tube (organ).
