FUNCTION

$
This machine is used to get an imprint of the data on a paper.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of type bars, key levers and keys.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The mechanical typewriter generally functions on the following principle: when any particular key is pressed, a system of levers and linkages causes the corresponding type bar to strike the paper through an inked ribbon. The imprint of the raised key is thereby formed on the paper, which is usually wrapped around the cylinder.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to type documents on the paper. This can be discussed as follows:

The key (part) is pressed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied is enough to cause the motion (organ).

The key lever (part) rotates about the hinge (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the key (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied is sufficient enough to overcome the spring force (organ).

The type bar (part) rotates about the hinge and presses against the paper through the inked pad (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the key lever (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the inked is a flexible material (organ).
