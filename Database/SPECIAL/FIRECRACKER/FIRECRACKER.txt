FUNCTION

$
Firecrackers when explode produce loud sound. For this they use chemical energy of black powder, which is filled in a tight paper tube.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Firecrackers have black powder packed in a tight paper tube. This black powder is ignited with the help of a fuse, which is nothing, but a cotton thread coated with black powder, which can be ignited. This fuse gives required heat energy for starting the chemical reactions of the powder inside the tight tube.
$

BEHAVIOUR

$
Fuse of the firecracker is ignited by some external heat source. This is due to chemical energy getting converted into heat energy, which actuates the laws of thermodynamics, and combustion, which requires that ignition temperature reaches and there is continuity of black powder in the fuse. Black powder inside the tight paper tube gets ignited. This is due to energy provided by the fuse, which actuates the laws of thermodynamics, and combustion, and requires correct chemical composition of black powder and presence of oxidizer in it. Tight tube bursts and gives loud sound. This is due to generation of high-pressure gases due to combustion of black powder, which actuates the laws of thermodynamics, and combustion, and requires correct thickness of paper tube and right chemical composition of black powder.

SUMMARY
$
Firecrackers when explode produce loud sound. For this they use chemical energy of black powder, which is filled in a tight paper tube. Its working is explained below,

Fuse (part) of the firecracker is ignited by some external heat source (physical phenomenon). This is due to chemical energy (input) getting converted into heat energy, which actuates the laws of thermodynamics, and combustion (physical effect), which requires that ignition temperature reaches and there is continuity of black powder in the fuse (organ).

Black powder inside the tight paper tube (part) gets ignited (physical phenomenon). This is due to energy provided by the fuse (input), which actuates the laws of thermodynamics, and combustion (physical effect), and requires correct chemical composition of black powder and presence of oxidizer in it (organ).

Tight tube (part) bursts and gives loud sound (physical phenomenon). This is due to generation of high-pressure gases (input) due to combustion of black powder, which actuates the laws of thermodynamics, and combustion (physical effect), and requires correct thickness of paper tube and right chemical composition of black powder (organ)
