SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to trim grass. It can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to oscillation. This device can be described as follows:

The ½ inch pinion gear (part) rotates 
(Physical phenomenon). This is due to rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the pinion gear and the input shaft (organ).

The large spur gear (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pinion gear (input), which activates the law “no bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between the large spur gear and the Pinion gear (organ).

The eccentric pin (part) on the large spur gear oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the spur gear (input), which activates the Newtonian law of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the pin and the large spur gear (organ).


The upper blade (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the oscillation of pin (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the pin and the upper blade (organ).
