FUNCTION

$
Trimming the grass around flower beds, fences and walks with a hand trimmer has long been the bane of gardeners. With either of two types of electric grass trimmers illustrated alongside, the chore is made easy.
$


STRUCTURE

$
One type of machine has a set of fork-like shears protruding from the front of the trimmer. The other employs a rotary blade located beneath the motor housing. The batteries of both machines are located in the handle and can be recharged by plugging the trimmers into a wall socket overnight.

The clipping shears of the fork-blade type of electric trimmer are powered by a direct-current motor. A 1/2-inch pinion gear drives a series of gears terminating in a large spur gear with an off-center pin that engages a slot in the upper cutting blade. This upper blade is pivoted to the lower stationary blade at a point just above the forks.
The rotary electric lawn clipper has a single sharp edged stainless-steel blade, which is driven by the electric motor. Below the blade is a metal loop, which is fastened to the frame of the machine.

$


BEHAVIOUR

$
Both machines run on battery power. 
When the motor of the fork-blade type trimmer rotates, it drives the large spur gear. The rotation of this spur gear causes the eccentric pin to oscillate in the slot of the upper moving blade. The upper blade oscillates at a rate of 6,000 strokes per minute. The lower blade is stationary. This causes a shearing effect that is causal in the grass being cut. 

In the rotary lawn clipper, the single blade whirls around, scything off the grass. The metal loop keeps the clipper at the desired height off the ground. The cutting blade is easily replaced. The6-volt motor operates at over 8,000 rpm.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to trim grass. It can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to oscillation. This device can be described as follows:

The ½ inch pinion gear (part) rotates 
(Physical phenomenon). This is due to rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the pinion gear and the input shaft (organ).

The large spur gear (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pinion gear (input), which activates the law “no bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between the large spur gear and the Pinion gear (organ).

The eccentric pin (part) on the large spur gear oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the spur gear (input), which activates the Newtonian law of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the pin and the large spur gear (organ).


The upper blade (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the oscillation of pin (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the pin and the upper blade (organ).
