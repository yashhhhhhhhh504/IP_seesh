FUNCTION

$
The drop weight device is used for certain mechanical testing purposes, $


STRUCTURE

$
The mechanism consists of a spring, arresting lever and a drop weight.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The potential energy stored in the weight in its raised position is released when the lever is swung to the right, thereby disengaging the catch.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism is used for testing materials. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to free falling motion. This can be discussed as follows:

The arresting lever (part) is moved away from the weight (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the arresting lever and the hinged joint (organ).

The weight (part) falls freely (physical phenomenon). This is due to the gravitational force (input), which activates the gravity effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the weight has some mass (organ).
