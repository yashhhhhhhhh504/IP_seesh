FUNCTION

$
 This mechanism is used in rifles. The striker cocking mechanism in a rifle keeps the energy locked in the compressed spring. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
This mechanism consists of a striker, spring, locking pin and trigger.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
When the trigger is pulled to the right, it first compresses the spring even more. Then as a result of the inclined guiding surface, the locking pin is slid downwards so the striker can fly to the right, propelled by the force of the spring.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism is used in rifles. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to linear motion of the striker. This can be described as follows:

The trigger (part) is pressed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the trigger has some inertia (organ).

The looking pin (part) slides downward (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the trigger (input), which activates the wedge effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the guiding surface is inclined (organ).

The spring (part) is compressed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the locking pin (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the spring has some stiffness (organ).

The striker (part) propels in the forward direction (physical phenomenon). This is due to the spring force (input), which activates the spring effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the spring has some stiffness (organ).
