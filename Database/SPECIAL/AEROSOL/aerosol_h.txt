SUMMARY
$
An aerosol dispenser is a device designed to produce a fine spray of liquid or solid particles that can be suspended in a gas such as the atmosphere. This is can be interpreted as a change of state from liquid to gas follows:

The push-button (part) moves down (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a gap between the valve push button and the surface of the bottle (organ).

The stem opening (part) moves down into the expansion chamber (physical phenomenon). This is due to the downward motion of the valve push button (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the stem opening is just above the valve (organ).


The liquid (part) in the expansion chamber moves in to the valve through the stem opening (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure gradient (input), which activates? (Physical effect) and requires the presence of high pressure within the dispenser (organ).

The liquid (part) now comes out of the atomizing nozzle and becomes a fine spray (physical phenomenon). This is due to decrease in the boiling point of the liquid (input), which activates? (Physical effect) and requires the presence of low pressure outside the dispenser (organ).
