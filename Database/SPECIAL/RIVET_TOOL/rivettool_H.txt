SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to rivet. It can be interpreted as a change of state from separate sheets to joined sheets. This can be described as follows:

The clamp (part) wedges the mandrel shank against the grip (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied at the handle (input), which activates the lever effect (physical effect) and requires that the mandrel shank be held tightly in the rivet tool (organ). 


The mandrel shank (part) is pulled (physical phenomenon). This is due to the upward force applied on it (input), Which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the upward force is greater than the gravitational force (organ).


The hollow rivet body (part) balloons out (physical phenomenon). This is due to the upward movement of the rivet head (input), which activates the law  “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires that the head is stronger enough to cause the bending of the hollow rivet body (organ).

The rivet head (part) breaks (physical phenomenon). This is due to the resisting force applied on it by the hollow rivet body (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a weakened portion near the head region (organ).
