SUMMARY
$
This can be used as a clamp. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation of the flexible beam about the living hinge. This can be discussed as follows:

The flexible beam (part) rotates about the living hinge (physical phenomenon). This is due to the moment applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the flexible beam and the living hinge (organ).

Now the clamp is open and rods or things that have to be clamped is placed in the open space.

The flexible beam (part) is again rotated towards the center of the clamp (physical phenomenon). This is due to the moment applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the flexible beam and the living hinge (organ).
