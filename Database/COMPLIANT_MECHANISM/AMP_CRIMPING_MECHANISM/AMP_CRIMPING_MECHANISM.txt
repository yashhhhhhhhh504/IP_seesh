FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used to hold substances.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of handgrips and the output ports that are made up of the same material.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The handgrips are operated to hold and relive objects at the output ports.

SUMMARY

$

This can be used to hold materials. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to reciprocating motion of the slider. This can be described as follows:

The input link (part) is made to rotate about the hinged joint (physical phenomenon). This is due to the moment applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the input link and the hinged joint (organ).

The connecting link (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input link (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the connecting link and the input link (organ).

The slider (part) reciprocates along the guide ways (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the connecting link (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of smooth surface between the slider and the guide ways (organ).
