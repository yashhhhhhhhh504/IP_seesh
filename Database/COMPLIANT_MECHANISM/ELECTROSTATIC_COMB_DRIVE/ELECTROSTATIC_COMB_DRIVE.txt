FUNCTION

$
The electrostatic comb drives are sometimes used as actuators in micro mechanical devices. 
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of stationary electrode, folded beam, anchor, movable shuttle and comb fingers.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The actuation force comes from the electrostatic forces when a voltage difference is applied between the stationary electrode and the movable shuttle.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to providing actuation. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to linear motion of the comb fingers. This can be described as follows:

The movable shuttle (part) moves linearly (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force (input) applied on it, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of a smooth surface between the movable shuttle and the surface (organ).

The folded beams (part) deflect (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the movable shuttle (input), which activates the bending effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the folded beams are flexible (organ).

The anchor (part) remains in the same place (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rigidity of the anchor (input), which activates the rigidity effect (physical effect) and is necessary that anchor has some rigidity (organ).
