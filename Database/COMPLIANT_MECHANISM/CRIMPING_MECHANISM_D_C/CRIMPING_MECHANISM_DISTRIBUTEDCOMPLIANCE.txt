FUNCTION


$
This is a crimping mechanism wherein a large portion of the structure deforms.
$


STRUCTURE

$
If a larger portion of the structure deforms, then it is called distributed compliance.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The bending moment is applied at the tips of the handle.

SUMMARY
$

This mechanism can be used to hold materials. This can be described as a change of state from rest to rotation of the output ports. This can be discussed as follows:

The hand grip (part) is brought close to each other (physical phenomenon). This is due to the moment applied (input) on it which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the hand grip and the hinged joint (organ).

The output port (part) rotates about the hinged joint and thus holds the material tightly (physical phenomenon). This rotation of the hand grips (input) which activates the lever effect (physical effect) and it is necessary that the hinged joint forms the fulcrum (organ).

ACTION

$ 
 To hold materials.
$

STATE

$
The output ports are at rest.

The output ports rotate.
