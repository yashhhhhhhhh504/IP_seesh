FUNCTION

$
The compliant gripper mechanism is used to grip silicon chips in various solutions.
$


STRUCTURE

$
These grippers are constructed of polytetrafluoroethylene so that it is inert to chemicals to which it is exposed.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The cantilever spring is used to provide adequate return force.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to grip silicon chips. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation of the output ports. This can be described as follows:

The handgrips (part) are brought close each other (physical phenomenon). This is due to the moment applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that one end of the handgrips are hinged (organ).

The output ports (part) come close each other and hold the material (physical phenomenon). This is due to rotation of the handgrips (input), which activates the lever effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the hinged joint acts as a fulcrum (organ).
