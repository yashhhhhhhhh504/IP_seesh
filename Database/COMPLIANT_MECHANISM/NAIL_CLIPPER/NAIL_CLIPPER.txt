FUNCTION

$
This device is used to cut nails present on the fingers of lower and upper limbs.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of two sharp edged gripping hands and a small rod passes through the holes present in the gripping hands. The rotating link rotates due to the force applied at its tip.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The force is applied at the tip of the rotating link, which is transferred on to the gripping hands, which cuts the nails.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to cut nails. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation of the link. This can be discussed as follows:

The rotatable link (part) is rotated (physical phenomenon). This is due to the moment applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the link and the fixed link (organ).

The oscillating link (part) oscillates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the rotatable link (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time”, (physical effect) and is necessary that the rotatable link is strong enough to move the oscillating link (organ).

The nail (part) is cut (physical phenomenon). This is due to the relative motion between the fixed link and oscillating link (input), which activates the shearing effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied is greater than the strength of the nail (organ).
