FUNCTION

$
In this mechanism the input force is transferred to the output port, much like the vise grip, only some new energy is stored in the form of strain energy in the flexible members.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The compliant mechanism has fewer movable joints, such as pin and sliding joints. These results in reduced wear and need for lubrication.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
A compliant mechanism also transfers or transforms motion, force or energy. Unlike rigid link mechanism, however, compliant mechanisms gain at least some their mobility from the deflection of flexible members rather than from movable joints only.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to grip materials. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The hand grips (part) are brought close each other (physical phenomenon). This is due to bending moment applied (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the 
Handgrips are hinged at one of their ends (organ).

The output ports (part) hold the material tightly (physical phenomenon). This is due to the bending of the handgrips (input), which activates the 
Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the output ports are hinged at one of their ends (organ).
