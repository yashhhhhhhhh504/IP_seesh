FUNCTION

$
This device is used to curl the eyelashes.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of sliding part and a guide ways.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The flat portion is pressed downwards and the sliding part slides in the guide ways thus curling the eyelashes.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to curl the eyelashes. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to sliding motion of the slider. This can be discussed as follows:

The spring (part) is compressed (physical phenomenon). This is due to the compressing force (input) applied on it, which activates the hooks law (physical effect) and is necessary that the spring has some stiffness (organ).

The slider (part) slides along the guide ways (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the link (input) connecting the slider and the spring top, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of a smooth surface between the slider and the guide ways (organ).

 The eyelashes (part) are curled (physical phenomenon). This is due to the sliding motion (input) of the slider, which activates the gripping effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the slider is blocked at the end of its travel (organ).
