FUNCTION

$
This mechanism can be used to open and close the bag.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It is made up of a flexible material and in one piece.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The two ends of the latch are made up of a flexible material; they bend and then regain their original shape.

SUMMARY

$
This mechanism can be used to pack bags. This can be interpreted as a change of state from latch outside its mating part to latch inside its mating part. This can be described as follows:

The latch (part) is moved inside the mating part (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the latch is made up a flexible material (organ).

The two ends of the latch (part) bend (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the latch into the mating part (input), which activates the bending effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the width of the latch is greater than that of the mating parts (organ).

The two ends of the latch (part) regain their original position thus locking it (physical phenomenon). This is due to the energy stored (input), which activates the spring effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the ends of the latch are made up of flexible material (organ).
