SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to bind papers. This can be interpreted as a change of state from small gap between the faces of the clamp to large gap between the faces of the clamp. This can be described as follows:

The hand grips (part) are rotated (physical phenomenon). This is due moment applied on it (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that moment applied is sufficient to cause the bending of the hand grips (organ).

The faces (part) of the clamp are pulled apart (physical phenomenon). This is due to bending of the handgrips (input), which activates the lever effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the base of the plastic forms a fulcrum (organ).

Now the papers that have to be kept together are kept in the gap between the two plastic faces. 

The faces (part) of clamp hold on to the paper tightly (physical phenomenon). This is due to the release of the handgrips (input), which activates the spring effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the clamp is made up of a flexible material (organ).
