FUNCTION

$
This is used to close shampoo bottles.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The entire cap is made up of one material. This is a very good example of compliant mechanism.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
A slight projection is given in the rotating link to provide sufficient grip while pulling it.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism is usually used to close and open shampoo bottles. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation. This can be described as follows:

The rotatable part (part) of the cap is rotated (physical phenomenon). This is due to the moment applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of one degree of freedom between the rotatable part and the fixed part (organ).


$

ACTION

$ 
 To open and close shampoo bottles.
$

STATE

$
The rotatable part is at rest.

The rotatable part is rotating about the hinge.


$

PHYPHENOMENON

$
 The rotatable part of the cap is rotated.


$


PHYEFFECT

$
Newtonian laws of motion.




$


INPUT

$
The moment applied on it.


$


ORGAN

$
Presence of one degree of freedom between the rotatable part and the fixed part.


$



PARTS
$
The rotatable part forms a revolute pair with the fixed part.
