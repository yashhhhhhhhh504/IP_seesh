FUNCTION

$
This device is used to take portion of the ice cream from the mass and to put it on to the cone or cup.
$


STRUCTURE

$
It consists of a flexible beam and rack and pinion arrangement.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The force is applied on to the rack and pinion arrangement to operate which in turn rotates the rotating blade.

SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to take a scoop of ice cream. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rest to rotation of the rotating blade. This can be described as follows:

The rack (part) is moved (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the force applied enough to cause the motion (organ).

The pinion (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the rack (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time”, (physical effect) and is necessary that the pitch of the rack and the pinion are appropriate (organ).

The shaft (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the pinion (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the pinion (organ).

The rotating blade (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the shaft and the rotating blade (organ).
