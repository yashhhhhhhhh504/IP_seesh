FUNCTION

$
A torsion spring is a spring that works by torsion or twisting; that is, a flexible elastic object that stores mechanical energy when it is twisted.
$


STRUCTURE

$
A torsion spring is often made from a wire, ribbon, or bar of metal or rubber, while more delicate ones are made of silk, glass, or quartz fibers.

BEHAVIOUR

$
A torsion spring is a spring that works by torsion or twisting; that is, a flexible elastic object that stores mechanical energy when it is twisted.

SUMMARY
$
A torsion spring is a spring that works by torsion or twisting; that is, a flexible elastic object that stores mechanical energy when it is twisted. That can be described as; Spring (part) twists (physical phenomena). This is due to torque applied on it (input) which activates spring effect (physical effect) and it requires that the applied force is within proportional limit of spring (organ).

Spring (part) stores energy (physical phenomena). This is due to twisting of spring (input) which activates spring effect (physical effect) and it requires that the applied force is within proportional limit of spring (organ).

Spring (part) releases energy (physical phenomena). This is due to release of torque applied on it (input) which spring effect (physical effect) and it requires that the applied force is within proportional limit of spring (organ).
