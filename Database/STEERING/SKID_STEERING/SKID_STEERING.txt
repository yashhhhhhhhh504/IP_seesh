FUNCTION

$
To turn/steer vehicle
$


STRUCTURE

$
There is no explicit steering mechanism.
$

BEHAVIOUR

$
There is no explicit steering mechanism--as the name implies steering is accomplished by actuating each side at a different rate or in a different direction, causing the wheels or tracks to slip, or skid, on the ground.

SUMMARY
$
Skid-steer locomotion is commonly used on tracked vehicles such as tanks and bulldozers. This can be described as follows:

Wheels (part) on each side move forward and backward (physical phenomena). This is due to the rotation of motor (input) which activates Newton’s second law of motion (physical effect) and it is necessary that there is zero degree of freedom between output shaft of motor and wheel (organ).

Vehicle (part) turns (physical phenomena). This is due to couple produced by wheel shaft (input) which activates Newton’s second law of motion (physical effect) and it is necessary that there is some friction between wheel and the ground (organ).
