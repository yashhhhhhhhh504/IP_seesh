SUMMARY
$
This device can be used to pump water from below the ground level. This can be interpreted as a change of state from water being at a lower level to water at higher level. This can be described as follows:

The half of the water that reaches the impeller (part) is sent back through the pressure pipe (physical phenomenon). This is due to the gravitational force (input), which activates the gravity effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of a pipe that runs vertically downward (organ).

The water’s (part) velocity increases (physical phenomenon). This is due to the decrease in the area of cross section (input), which activates the law of conservation of mass (physical effect) and requires the presence of a nozzle at the end of the pressure pipe (organ).

The water’s (part) velocity further increases (physical phenomenon). This is due to the decrease in the cross sectional area (input), which activates the law of conservation of mass (physical effect) and requires the presence of a venturi and it also requires that the nozzle enters into the suction pipe (organ).

 The water (part) rushes in the upward direction through the intake (physical phenomenon). This is due to the low-pressure region created above the venturi (input), which activates the Bernoulli’s effect (physical effect) and requires that the increase in the velocity should be sufficient enough to create the required pressure difference (organ).
