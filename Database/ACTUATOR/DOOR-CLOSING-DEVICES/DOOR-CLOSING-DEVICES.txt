FUNCTION

$
The door closer is familiar device that automatically closes the opened door. The simplest type works merely with a coil spring. It has the disadvantage of that the door is shut rather violently. For this reason a more sophisticated device is used, which develops a slow closing movement.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The entire set up consists of a cylinder arrangement and a regulating screw. It also consists of spring and spindle. A regulating screw provides the means of compensating for the differences in the viscosity of the oil at different temperatures.


$
BEHAVIOUR

$
When the door is opened, the piston withdrawn and the oil in the cylinder opens a ball valve in a passage provided in the piston and flows into the space provided on the right of the piston. The main arm connects the spindle to the door.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism is usually used to close the doors. This can be interpreted as a change of state from opening of door to closing of door. This can be described as follows:

The piston (part) in the cylinder moves to the left (physical phenomenon). This is due to the opening of the door (input) which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it requires the presence of a smooth surface between the piston and the cylinder walls (organ).

The oil (part) present in the cylinder moves to the right of the piston through the ball valve (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure difference (input) between the left of the piston and the right of the piston, which activates the Bernoulli’s effect (physical effect) and it is necessary that the oil is able to flow through the passage (organ).

The ball valve (part) is closed (physical phenomenon). This is due spring force (input), which activates the hooks law (physical effect) and is necessary that the spring has enough stiffness (organ).

The piston (part) moves to the right thus moving the oil out through the return passage (physical phenomenon).  This is due to the closing of the ball valve (input), which activates the resistance to flow (physical effect) and is necessary that the oil is not leaked out of the system (organ).
