FUNCTION

$
Electromagnets are popular actuators. Electromagnets are widely used in technology and are the essential components of relays and circuit breakers . Electromagnets are also used in electromagnetic clutches and brakes. In some street cars, electromagnetic brakes grip directly onto the rails. Very large electromagnets having cores several meters in diameter are used in cyclotrons, and high-power electromagnets are used to lift iron parts or scrap. They are also widely used in the manufacture of electric calling bells.
$


STRUCTURE

$
A coil of wire with electricity flowing through it acts as a bar magnet. However, the magnetism can be controlled by turning the current on or off. The strength of the electro-magnet can be improved by either increasing number of coils, increasing the current or by using an iron core (iron magnetises and demagnetises quickly, whereas steel takes time to magnetise and demagnetise).
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
An electric current passed through the coil induces a strong magnetic field along the axis of the helix . When the iron core is placed in this field, microscopic domains that can be considered small permanent magnets in the iron align themselves in the direction of the field, thus increasing greatly the strength of the magnetic field produced by the solenoid. The magnetization of the core reaches saturation once all the domains are completely aligned, and an increase of the current in the solenoid has little further effect. When the current is switched off, the core retains only a weak residual magnetism.

The first figure shows how a simple electromagnet can be devised making use of a simple nail and a battery assembly.
The second figure shows an electromagnet assembly consists of a soft iron core u-magnet wrapped with heavy duty copper wire. The electromagnet can be activated with a battery or power supply (an old model train transformer will do) to demonstrate the principles of electromagnetism.
The third figure demonstrates the way in which electromagnets can be used industrially to life heavy weights.
Figure 04 shows the application of electromagnets in electric calling bells.

SUMMARY
$
This can be used to produce sound in doorbells. This can be used as follows:

The iron striker (part) gets magnetized (physical phenomenon). This is due to the flow of electricity in the coils that are wound around it (input), which activates magnetic effect (physical effect) and requires that the grains in the iron core are oriented towards it (organ).

The iron striker (part) strikes against the bell (physical phenomenon). This is due to the magnetic force between the striker and the bell (input), which activates the magnetic effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the bell lies within the magnetic field (organ).


The iron striker (part) comes back to its original position (physical phenomenon). This is due to the restoring force applied by the spring, which in turn is due to the break in the circuit (input), which activates the hook’s law (physical effect) 
and is necessary that the spring has some stiffness (organ).
