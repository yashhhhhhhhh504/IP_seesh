FUNCTION

$
Computer keyboards monitor the state of switches.
$


STRUCTURE

$
Computer keyboards monitor the state of switches. They key caps, plunger, and rubber dome with carbon center. Force applied by human finger is transmitted through plunger to rubber dome, which acts as a spring to come back to original position when the force on the key cap is released.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$

Key cap presses down the plunger. This is because of the force applied by user. The plunger presses flexible rubber dome down. This is due to the transmission of force from plunger to rubber dome, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion and requires contact between rubber dome and plunger. Carbon center of the rubber dome makes the contact. This is due to movement in the downward direction towards contacts, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion and requires perfect electrical connection for the contact. Human finger moves and so rubber dome moves up and the contact breaks. This is due to release of force on key cap from human finger, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion and requires good spring action of the rubber dome.

SUMMARY
$
Computer keyboards monitor the state of switches. They key caps, plunger, rubber dome with carbon center. It is explained below,

Key cap (part) presses down the plunger (physical phenomenon). This is due to force (input) applied by key cap on the plunger, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires physical connection between plunger and key cap (organ).

Flexible rubber dome (part) is pressed down by the plunger (physical phenomenon). This is due to the transmission of force (input) from plunger to rubber dome, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires contact between rubber dome and plunger (organ).

Carbon center (part) of the rubber dome makes the contact (physical phenomenon). This is due to movement (input) in the downward direction towards contacts, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires perfect electrical connection for the contact (organ).

Human finger (part) moves and so rubber dome moves up and the contact breaks (physical phenomenon). This is due to release of force (input) on key cap from human finger, which actuates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires good spring action of the rubber dome (organ).
