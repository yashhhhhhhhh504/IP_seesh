FUNCTION

$
The disc brakes are a lot like the brakes on a bicycle. But instead of squeezing the wheel directly the brake pads squeeze a rotor disc that is connected to the wheel.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The single piston floating caliper disc brake is the most common type. This design is self-centering and self-adjusting. The caliper is able to slide from side to side.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
The caliper is able to slide from side to side, so it moves to the center each time the brakes are applied. Also there is no spring to pull the pads away from the disc.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to stop the motion of the wheel. This can be interpreted as a change of state from motion to rest. This can be described as follows:

The piston (part) in the master cylinder slides (physical phenomenon). This is due to the force applied on the brake pedal (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth sliding surface between the cylinder and the piston (organ).

The fluid (part) is pumped out of the cylinder into the pipes (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the piston (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and is necessary that the pressure within the cylinder is greater than the pressure in the pipes (organ).

The friction pads (part) slides and holds the moving wheel (physical phenomenon). This is due to the flow of fluid (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of a smooth surface between the piston and the cylinder (organ).
