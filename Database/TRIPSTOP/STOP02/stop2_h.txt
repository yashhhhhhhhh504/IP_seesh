SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to the prevent machines from getting damaged. This mechanism can be described as follows :


The beamer reel (part) rotates and rolls the thread on it (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of zero degree of freedom between the input shaft and the beamer reel (organ).


The L shaped link (part), which is positioned just above the contact bar, is held up and thus the gap between the L shaped link and the contact bar maintained (physical phenomenon). This is due to the tension (input) in the thread that passes through the eyelet of the L shaped link, which activates Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of a tensile force that is greater than the gravitational force (organ).


The yarn package (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the friction between the moving thread and the pulley surface (input), which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of friction surface between the pulley and the thread (organ).

The beamer reel (part) stops rotating (physical phenomenon). This is due to the breaking of the thread, which in turn brings the L shaped link in contact with the contact bar (input) which activates the gravitational effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between the contact bar and the electronic relay system (organ).
