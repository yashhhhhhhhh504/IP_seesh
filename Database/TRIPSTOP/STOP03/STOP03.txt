FUNCTION

$
This mechanism is used to arrest the functioning of a tubular braiding machine when the thread breaks during operation.
$


STRUCTURE

$
The spool over which the thread is initially wound is coupled to a ratchet wheel. From the spool, the thread runs over two idlers and finally through an opening in the standard to the final component. The two idlers are mounted on an idler carrier, which can traverse along the standard on a prismatic joint. A tension spring attached to the frame of the standard holds the pawl in position.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
The machine braids by feeding thread in a circular fashion. This is achieved when the standard frame is made to follow a circular-like path, as shown by the arrows in the figure. When the machine is braiding, there exists a tension on the wire or thread. This tension causes the idler carrier to be lifted. The upward motion of the idler carrier causes the pawl to be released from the ratchet on the spool flange and allows the spool to turn and unwind. When the machine stops, the tension in the wire decreases again and the idler carrier falls, enabling the pawl to engage with the ratchet. If a wire breaks while the machine is running, the unsupported idler carrier falls to the base of the standard. When the standard arrives at the station in the raceway adjacent to the cam 'C', the lug on the idler carrier strikes the cam 'C', rotating it far enough to disengage a clutch on the driving shaft and thereby stopping the mechanism.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to arrest the functioning of the tubular braiding machine when the thread breaks during the operation. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The spool (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the ratchet is free to rotate (organ).

The ratchet (part) freely rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the absence of contact between the pawl and ratchet (organ).


The pawl (part) is not in contact with the ratchet (physical phenomenon). This is due to the upward motion of the idler carrier (input), which activates the law “ no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of tension in the thread (organ).


The idler carrier (part) comes down (physical phenomenon). This is due to the loss of tension in the thread, which in turn is due to the breaking of the thread (input), which activates the gravitational effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of gravity (organ).


The standard (part) comes down and makes contact with the clutch thus disengages it (physical phenomenon). This is due to the downward motion of the idler career (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of gravity (organ).
