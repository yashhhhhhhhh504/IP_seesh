SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to arrest the functioning of the tubular braiding machine when the thread breaks during the operation. This mechanism can be described as follows:

The spool (part) rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the ratchet is free to rotate (organ).

The ratchet (part) freely rotates (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the input shaft (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the absence of contact between the pawl and ratchet (organ).


The pawl (part) is not in contact with the ratchet (physical phenomenon). This is due to the upward motion of the idler carrier (input), which activates the law “ no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of tension in the thread (organ).


The idler career (part) comes down (physical phenomenon). This is due to the loss of tension in the thread, which in turn is due to the breaking of the thread (input), which activates the gravitational effect (physical effect) and requires the presence of gravity (organ).


The standard (part) down and makes contact with the clutch thus disengages it (physical phenomenon). This is due to the downward motion of the idler career (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the presence of gravity (organ).
