FUNCTION

$
This is employed to quickly stop the train in motion. This is one of the powerful means, it employs  compressed air.
$


STRUCTURE

$
This system comprises of a compressor, which supplies compressed air to the main air reservoir, and then via the drivers brake valve and the main brake pipe to the auxiliary air reservoirs. The main brake pipe extends through all the carriages of the train.
$
BEHAVIOUR

$
When driver wishes to apply the brake he moves the control lever of the brake valve to the appropriate position. As a result, the main brake pipe is put into communication with external air and the pressure in this pipe goes down to the atmospheric pressure. On completion of the braking operation the control lever of the drivers brake valve is returned to the initial position.

SUMMARY
$
This mechanism can be used to stop the motion of the wheel. This can be interpreted as a change of state from rotation to rest. This can be interpreted as follows:

The hand wheel (part) rotates in the vertical plane through a small angle (physical phenomenon). This is due to the torque (input) applied on it, which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and it is necessary that the hand wheel has some inertia (organ).

The main brake pipe (part) communicates with the atmospheric air (physical phenomenon). This is due to the rotation of the hand wheel (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires the presence of contact between the main brake pipe and the hand wheel (organ).

The brake valve (part) moves up thus opening the entry for the cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure difference (input) between the main brake pipe and the auxiliary reservoir, which activates the Bernoulli’s law (physical effect) and is necessary that the pressure of the air inside the auxiliary cylinder is greater than the pressure in the brake pipe (organ).

The air (part) from the auxiliary reservoir into the cylinder (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the valve (input), which activates the vacuum effect (physical effect) and is necessary that the valve opening is sufficient enough for the air to flow (organ).

The piston (part) in the cylinder and thus causes the brake block to be pressed hard against the wheel (physical phenomenon). This is due to the pressure applied by the compressed air (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and is necessary that the gap between the piston and the cylinder is as small as possible (organ).


The wheels (part) stop rotating (physical phenomenon). This is due to the friction force (input) between the wheels and the brake block which activates the friction effect (physical effect) and it requires the presence of a friction surface between the brake block and the wheel (organ).
