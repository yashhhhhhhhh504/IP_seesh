FUNCTION

$
Automatic stopping mechanisms prevent machines from damaging themselves or destroying work in progress. The mechanism shown in the figure is used to limit the stroke of a reciprocating machine member.
$


STRUCTURE

$
An adjustable dog is used in this mechanism to limit the stroke. The reciprocating member traverses along the T-slot in the machine table during normal operation. At the position where the stroke has to be limited, the adjustable dog is clamped into place. The far end of the dog is in contact with a latch, which is pivoted to the machine table. The latch in turn holds the clutch and brake operating shaft in place with the help of an extension spring.
$


BEHAVIOUR

$
During normal operation, the member reciprocates upto a position behind the dog continuously. However, in case the member overshoots, it will hit against the dog. This will push the dog out of place, which in turn will displace the pivoted latch. Thus the clutch operating shaft will no longer be held in position by the end of the latch, and the spring pulls it back, causing the machine to stop.

SUMMARY
$
The adjustable dog (part) rotates about the point where it is hinged on to the machine table (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the member, which is overshooting (input) which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the positioning of the dog in the path of the reciprocating member (organ).

The latch (part) is displaced from its original position (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the dog (input), which activates the law “no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time” (physical effect) and requires the proper positioning of the latch (organ).

The clutch and brake -operating shaft (part) is released from the latch and is pulled back which in turn will bring the machine to a stop (physical phenomenon). This is due to the movement of the latch and also due to the pulling force applied by the spring attached to it (input), which activates the Newtonian laws of motion (physical effect) and requires that the spring have sufficient stiffness (organ). 
$





ACTION

 Using this mechanism overrunning of reciprocating members on the machine tool can be prevented.
